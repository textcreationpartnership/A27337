            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:59386:4"/>Dear Spou≈øe but I ought to prefer you before him. I have dedicated to them the two first. Books of the <hi>World Bewitch'd,</hi> and amongst all my Friends, who≈øe Names I intend to prefix to each part of the <hi>French Tran≈ølation,</hi> I have made choice of you for this, that is, the first of all, and going to be publi≈øh'd. It's above thirty years ≈øince I have the Honour to be acquainted with you, and about fifteen, ≈øince I am allied to you by your Marriage with the Lady <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riette Fullenia,</hi> the nearest Cou≈øin of my Spou≈øe, both from Father and Mother's ≈øide. It's likewi≈øe very near twenty years, ≈øince I was ≈øo happy as to ≈øee you a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the first College of the States of <hi>Frie≈øland,</hi> on who≈øe direction the good or had ≈øucce≈øs of my Affairs depended at that time. When occa≈øion has offer'd it ≈øelf, I receiv'd from you Te≈øtimonies of a ju≈øt favour and an ingenious di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Your Marriage tied more ≈øtrictly the Bands of the Friend≈øhip you had for me; and I have had the plea≈øure to ≈øee it lasting to this day. You gave me late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an obliging proof of it, when you were pleas'd to pre≈øent from me to his Highne≈øs,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:4"/>Prince <hi>Henry Ca≈øimir</hi> of <hi>Na≈ø≈øau,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Governor of our common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> my <hi>Frie≈øland's Divinity;</hi> which I had taken the liberty to dedicate to him.

               </gap>e≈øs calling him at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to different parts of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I could not be ≈øure ≈øo much as an hour of the place, where I might meet with him. This circum≈øtance procur'd me the Honour of receiving by the next Po≈øt a Letter from that Prince, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very expre≈øs Marks of his Affection; in which he al≈øo declar'd, that my Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had not been unplea≈øant to him. But I have ≈øtill another rea≈øon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages me to pre≈øent you with the Tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work, with which you ≈øeem'd very much pleas'd. It's your particular Concern in the Affairs of the Churches, in who≈øe Tongue 'tis written, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in all tho≈øe of our Holy Religion: To this you ince≈ø≈øantly apply your ≈øelf with a Zeal worthy of Imitation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, di≈øcharging ≈øtill in the <hi>Walloon</hi> Church of your City, the Honourable Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Elder, which you have formerly
<pb facs="tcp:59386:5"/>di≈øcharg'd many times; as well as in the Church of your Mother Tongue. Farther, I thought fit to cau≈øe this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe to be Tran≈ølated my ≈øelf, le≈øt ≈øome others ≈øhould undertake it, having been advis'd, that the Tran≈ølation of it had been begun in this Town, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nd el≈øewhere, without my knowledge; which however is happen'd, but ≈øince the late Synod of <hi>North-Holland;</hi> the proceedings that were made again≈øt me, having only been of u≈øe to excite the curio≈øity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as to this matter. And therefore I have prevented the de≈øigns of tho≈øe, who intended to make this Tran≈ølation, and provided at the ≈øame time, le≈øt any ≈øhould appear under my name, without my con≈øent, and my revi≈øing of it, as I may a≈ø≈øert that I have done this. It comes from a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who has carefully apply'd him≈øelf to the ≈øtudy of our Tongue, and ≈øeems to me to under≈øtand his own ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. For tho' I am not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant with it ≈øo far, as to have Tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my own Book my ≈øelf: yet I think that I am able to judge, that I ≈øhould not have better ≈øucceeded, nor more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly have render'd my own Thoughts,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:5"/>if I had been in a capacity of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it. Be≈øides, this Tran≈ølation being almo≈øt verbal, becau≈øe the quality of the Work required it; It is ≈øo much the more difficult, and worthy that its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ≈øhould be over-look'd. I think at lea≈øt, that no other difference will be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, betwixt it and the Original, but that of the Tongue; no real change having been made in it. I own that ≈øeveral matters of Fact have been added, and in≈øerted in divers places of this Book; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been left out, ≈øo that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øhall have no occa≈øion of complain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of his Lo≈ø≈øes; but rather of being glad of the new advantages that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him. I al≈øo have added after the Preface, an Abridgement of the whole Work, as a preliminary, that gives a general view and notion of it, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ≈øub≈øtance, the Contents of the three la≈øt Books, that are to be ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øively Tran≈ølated; the ≈øecond being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy far advanc'd. I only earne≈øtly wi≈øh, that you may be as well ≈øatisfied with my Dedication, as I am with this Tran≈ølati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <hi>A PREFACE, TO THE</hi> Whole WORK in General, <hi>AND THE</hi> Fir≈øt Book in particular.</head>
            <p>IF ever any Author thought the Treati≈øe he was publi≈øhing, needed an Introduction, methinks that I may not only have the ≈øame Opinion of this; but even that I cannot forbear it. Two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rea≈øons oblige me to it, one of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the circum≈øtances of what happened during the impre≈ø≈øion of this work, and the other, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it's contents. Both the≈øe Rea≈øons has ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, but the latter e≈øpecially appears ≈øtill more ≈øtrange, becau≈øe of the former; and therefore I intend to give the Reader ≈øome expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon both.</p>
            <p>Having form'd a de≈øign to write upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated of in this Book, I begun Eight Years ago in my Preface to the <hi>Book of Comets,</hi> to give ≈øome hints of what I intend to explain here more particularly. I had cho≈øen for the ≈øubject of my publick Sermons, the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when I was come to the 11th v. of the 2 Chapter, in which the <hi>Magicians</hi> confe≈øs, they were not capable
<pb facs="tcp:59386:7"/>of expounding the King's Dreams; I drew from that Declaration, ≈øuch inferences, as evidently ≈øhow'd what mu≈øt be believed concerning the extent of knowledge, a≈øcribed to the Devil; afterwards judging it convenient to examine his power, and whether it extends as far as is ordinarily ≈øaid; the fir≈øt occa≈øion I had of a≈øcending the Pulpit, I took my Text on <hi>Exodus</hi> Chap. 8. v. 18th, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned why the Magicians could not as ea≈øily produce Lice, as Frogs and Serpents. The late <hi>Sieur de Tami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninga,</hi> Lord of <hi>Belleingweer,</hi> a learned and pious Gentleman, heard my Sermon, and lik'd it extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; thinking that if what I had propo≈øed, were printed, it would obtain the approbation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding per≈øons, and inform the ignorant. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted me him≈øelf ≈øeveral times to print that di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, and imployed other per≈øons to de≈øire me to do it; but I was ≈øo taken up with other bu≈øine≈øs, as may be judged by the Books I have publi≈øhed, and by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance I have afforded my friends in the Edition of theirs, that I could not an≈øwer his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øo ≈øoon, th√¥ never ab≈øolutely denyed to do it. Since that time, I preached twice again on the ≈øame matter, on occa≈øion of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> went to con≈øult, and of the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In 1689, as I was explaining in the Ho≈øpital Church, the 19th and following ver≈øes of the 5th Chap. to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> I ≈øearched deeper into this matter, expounding the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> interpreters have tran≈ølated <hi>Poi≈øoning,</hi> and the <hi>Engli≈øh, Witchcraft.</hi> But as I could not compri≈øe in a Sermon, whatever was to be ≈øaid upon this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I referr'd my hearers to a fuller in≈øtruction, in a larger volum that I was going to publi≈øh. I have given an account why it was not undertaken
<pb facs="tcp:59386:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>before, and now I ≈øhall inform the Reader, why it has been ≈øo long in the Pre≈øs.</p>
            <p>Going from <hi>Francker</hi> to <hi>Loen,</hi> where I was call'd to be a Mini≈øter, I promi≈øed my Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeller <hi>H. Nauta,</hi> that to keep our old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I would give him to print the fir≈øt Treati≈øe I ≈øhould compo≈øe in <hi>Holland;</hi> almo≈øt as ≈øoon as I was come thither, there appeared a Comet in the Years 1680, and 1681, which gave me occa≈øion to write a Book, Intituled, <hi>An Examination of Comets,</hi> which I put out in 1683. But as the Book≈øeller de≈øired the Book might be ≈øomewhat larger, and I found it inconvenient to take care of a long impre≈ø≈øion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea; I obliged him to continue it for that time; promi≈øing him, that, if he ever re-printed the ≈øame Treati≈øe, I would either increa≈øe it; or add ≈øome other to it. I had no occa≈øion to keep to the fir≈øt promi≈øe, no body having ≈øaid or written any thing again≈øt it, that required a more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. And therefore I thought fit to hold my Second promi≈øe, by adding to my <hi>Examination of Comets,</hi> another tract upon a matter ≈øomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, and on which I had meditated a long time. To that end, I compo≈øed an <hi>Examination of Magick,</hi> and Witchcraft, that contained very near as many ≈øheets as that of Comets; and I cau≈øed in Autumn la≈øt, a new Edition to be made of the latter, on purpo≈øe to joyn it to this new Treati≈øe. But having ≈øometimes e≈øpecially in <hi>November</hi> 27th 1689, publickly confuted, in the Pulpit, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion; two days after, a Book was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me coming from <hi>England,</hi> where it was Printed, and Intituled, <hi>A Relation of the di≈øcovery of ≈øome Witchcrafts,</hi> in which very many particular things were ≈øaid to be contained. I thought by the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that it would quickly be tran≈ølated into our Tongue, to ≈øatisfy the curio≈øity of People. And
<pb facs="tcp:59386:8"/>as my Opinions are directly oppo≈øite to what is laid down in that Book, I perceived it might breed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices again≈øt what I had ≈øo freely and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Pulpit, and ≈øuch as I ≈øhould ≈øcarce be able to de≈øtroy afterwards; becau≈øe of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ≈øtrength of the proofs brought forth in that work; for that Rea≈øon, I rather cho≈øe to tran≈ølate it my ≈øelf, than to leave it to another, adding ≈øome remarks, fit to open the Eyes of the Reader, by di≈øcovering the grounds on which ≈øuch relations are laid; that he might not thereby be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed in the vulgar error; but that he might make u≈øe of the≈øe Annotations, until my compleat work concerning Magick and Witchcraft were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was to be, according to my expectation, in the following Months. But be≈øides the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of the Weather in Winter, and the di≈øtance of the place where it was printed, <hi>viz.</hi> beyond Sea, together with the Book of Mr. <hi>Ain≈øworth,</hi> for which the ≈øame pre≈øs was imployed, cau≈øed a great deal of delay; during that time, I had lea≈øure to review my Treati≈øe of Magick, and to increa≈øe it ≈øo, that it became much larger, than that of Comets; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, the tran≈ølation and publi≈øhing of the Engli≈øh Book, procured me letters from ≈øeveral learned Men, and afforded matter to many Conver≈øations, as well with tho≈øe that were of my Opinion, as with tho≈øe that were contrary to it. Thus having had occa≈øion to ≈øearch deeper into this ≈øubject, to give new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations of my Opinion, and to confirm them by new Rea≈øons; this works went on always increa≈øing, and the order and di≈øpo≈øition of it was ≈øo far chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that from a ≈ømall Book it became a bulky Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn. In the mean while, the impre≈ø≈øion that was made at <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> ≈øeem'd to me, not only ≈ølow, but al≈øo very inconvenient, by Rea≈øon of the faults of the Pre≈øs; of which I could not ≈øo well purge
<pb facs="tcp:59386:8"/>it, but that the fir≈øt Book is ≈øtill full of them. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved therefore to print the Second part at <hi>Am≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Some time pa≈øt, before that could ≈øucceed; however, without any inconveniency to the Book, for the Rea≈øons ju≈øt now alledged. The cau≈øe of this ≈ølowne≈øs being unknown, ≈øome were not afraid to publi≈øh, that I had lo≈øt courage, and dur≈øt not attempt to enter the Li≈øts with the Devil: tho≈øe Rumours, the que≈øtions that were continually put to me, and the writings that were ≈øent me, when my Treati≈øe was ju≈øt coming out, obliged me to publi≈øh the two fir≈øt Books, in which I mentioned ≈øomething of the two la≈øt, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plea≈øe the Reader. Be≈øides I hop'd, God would give me the Grace to make an end of the whole work, and to add what the Readers might think wanting or convenient. But it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the end of 1690, as I intended it, and the Book≈øeller de≈øired it, for his own Intere≈øt; for the Fro≈øt that came in on a ≈øudden, retarded the execution of it; it being not po≈ø≈øible to ≈øend the Three la≈øt ≈øheets to <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> and to get from thence tho≈øe that were printed there, by rea≈øon of the Ice that put a ≈øtop to Navigation; ≈øo that I could have no Copy to pre≈øent my friends with. I hoped ≈øtill however that it might be done, but the Fro≈øt continuing, my Book thus imperfect was publi≈øht, and came without my knowledge, into the hands of many People in <hi>Friezeland.</hi> It was therefore only ≈øeen by piece-meal and without cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, which gave occa≈øion to ≈øome of the Readers, and others that had heard of it, publickly to pa≈øs heard, judgments upon it; even ≈øome intended, as I am informed, to make me explain my ≈øelf more preci≈øely, had I not done it in the Book it ≈øelf. For at la≈øt, when they read it intire and in order, they all agreed, I had given all the explications that,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:9"/>could be wi≈øht, either as to the Rea≈øons that had moved me to write it; or as to to the ≈øcope I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to my ≈øelf, which appears in the Preface, and in the fir≈øt Chapter of the Book; or as to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity and u≈øefulne≈øs of its publi≈øhing, which I have ≈øhown in the ≈øame Chapter, and the la≈øt but one. They were ju≈øt the places that were wanting, for which Rea≈øon I wrote to the Book≈øeller of <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> and forbad him to give out any Copy of this Book, until the whole was compleat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, during the Fro≈øt, I had time to add two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the end of the Second Book, and to enlarge the Preface, in order to inform the Reader of my Opinions, and the purity of my intentions, which has not proved altogether fruitle≈øs; for I have heard that mo≈øt of tho≈øe, that have read the Preface and the work afterwards, have been ≈øatisfied, as they have told one another and my ≈øelf; whereas tho≈øe that had taken upon them to critici≈øe it, had read but ≈øome loo≈øe parcels of it, or had not read it at all, or perhaps had not ≈øo much as vouch≈øafed to read it.</p>
            <p>Things remained a while in that ≈øtate, every one enquiring after the Rea≈øon that hindered the publi≈øhing of my Book, and how it happened that I had none my ≈øelf, ≈øince it had been ≈øold in <hi>Frieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for ≈øome time. The Thaw came at la≈øt, and many Per≈øons arrived with News of the Edition of my Book, but brought no Copies along with them, ≈øave ≈øome privately, and as ≈øtolen goods; then every body wondered, a Book ≈øhould have been put out, in the≈øe Provinces, and it ≈øhould not be found in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Author lived; and not only my Brother Pa≈øtors ≈øhould not have ≈øeen it, but I ≈øhould ≈øay, I had none my ≈øelf to pre≈øent them with. At la≈øt I received 26 Copies of it from <hi>Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,</hi> but had ≈øcarce one for my ≈øelf; my friends came and took them away them≈øelves, as they were
<pb facs="tcp:59386:9"/>≈øowed; and mo≈øt of tho≈øe that ask'd for them, could not get 'em, unle≈øs they came ju≈øt when they were ≈øow'd up. So greedy Men are of Novelties, e≈øpecially when they can hardly get 'em.</p>

            <p>However it be, the Book could not be expo≈øed to Sale before the 11th day of <hi>March.</hi> A long time after I had ≈øent the la≈øt Sheets to <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> Book≈øeller, who had had the Book per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his hands for a long time, A Book≈øeller ask'd 50 Copies from him, and thought to receive them ≈øpeedily, but had none ≈øent to him. In the mean while, I find my ≈øelf much perplext. I was de≈øir'd, during two Months, by my be≈øt Friends, to communicate this Work to them, which they had never ≈øeen, and had heard commended; for this rea≈øon I wrote to Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> I would take all the Copies upon me; and pay them at ≈øuch rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rates, that he would be ≈øatisfied with it; he need but to ≈øend them to me without delay, with the fir≈øt Ve≈ø≈øel. Then I thought to con≈øult with my Friends, whether I ≈øhould ≈øell the two Fir≈øt Books, that had already appear'd imperfect in <hi>Frie≈øland,</hi> and el≈øewhere, or whether I ≈øhould keep them until the whole Work was fini≈øhed. The fir≈øt ≈øeem'd to be the be≈øt Advice, to avoid the ≈øu≈øpicion, that I dur≈øt not publi≈øh my Book, or that I was forced to ≈øuppre≈øs it, becau≈øe of many things that were ≈øpread abroad to di≈øcredit it; however, the la≈øt coun≈øel ≈øuited better with my inclinations. I conceived that a Work that was at fir≈øt but a ≈ømal Treati≈øe, th√¥ it had ≈øince been much enlarged, would be more favourably received, and prove of greater u≈øe, if it were given compleat at the ≈øame time to the publick; that the de≈øign and cohering of it
<pb facs="tcp:59386:10"/>might be better ≈øeen, its Doctrines be more ea≈øily comprehended, and the happy effects it was able to produce be more plainly perceived, which is chiefly done by the la≈øt Part. But as the cau≈øes before alledged, had already once ≈ømother'd this de≈øign, ≈øo they did it again this time; for percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Letters of Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> it was impo≈ø≈øible to agree with him, as to the price, and that it was unlikely he ≈øhould ever do it, I was at la≈øt forced to give up the Book to him, that I might (with the Ble≈ø≈øing of God,) pur≈øue my de≈øign. So having altogether broken with that Book≈øeller, I have agreed ≈øome Months ≈øince, with another of this City, Mr. <hi>Daniel Vanden Dalen,</hi> to put divers Pre≈ø≈øes going upon it, and re-print the whole Work, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and corrected, that I might ince≈ø≈øantly publi≈øh all the four Parts, one after another, in the form in wnich the Reader now ≈øees them. For as to the 750 Copies which Mr. <hi>Nauta</hi> had printed of the two Fir≈øt Books, and are mo≈øt of them ≈øtill upon his hands; they being an incon≈øiderble num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that could not go very far, and the ha≈øty Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Book, being as yet imperfect, ≈øeem'd to give room to a new Edition, that the Pulick might be more ≈øpeedily ≈øatisfied. I therefore here pre≈øent the Reader with the Fir≈øt Book, enlarged with a new Chapter, that I thought nece≈ø≈øary to add at the end. I hope, with the Ble≈ø≈øing of God, that the three others ≈øhall ≈øucce≈ø≈øively appear every Month; and I per≈øuade my ≈øelf, that the reading of the Fir≈øt Parts, will excite ≈øome Curio≈øities for the later; and that altogether may invite the Reader to a ≈øerious con≈øideration upon the Contents, and capacitate him to judge more ≈øoundly of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he did, while this Treati≈øe appear'd but in part, and confu≈øedly. This is what I had to ≈øay, as to this Edition, that was made in ≈øuch an
<pb facs="tcp:59386:10"/>extraordinary manner, and publi≈øh'd without my knowledge.</p>
            <p>I come now to treat of my ≈øcope, and what has obliged me to embrace the Opinions I a≈ø≈øert in this Book. In all my Studies I was always inclin'd, not to re≈øt upon probabilities, but to ≈øearch into the whole matter, and to get a clear and di≈øtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what I ≈øhould know. Be≈øides, many ≈øtrange things had happen'd to me in <hi>Frie≈øland,</hi> upon the fir≈øt Writings I had publi≈øh'd, and experience had a≈ø≈øured me, how little one ought to relye upon the Judgment of Men, e≈øpecially when what they are accu≈øtomed to teach, is call'd in que≈øtion. For is it not wonderful that my Book upon the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øm ≈øhould have been unanimou≈øly condemn'd in <hi>Frie≈øland,</hi> th√¥ among≈øt above 200 Mini≈øters, who con≈øented to that Judgment, none could alledge ≈øo much as one ≈øolid Rea≈øon again≈øt it; and that afterwards it ≈øhould have been twice unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly approved of, without any change, as to the Doctrine and the controverted Points, having been made in it? This has confirm'd me in this per≈øua≈øion, that a true Chri≈øtian, e≈øpecially a Doctor of Divinity, ought groundedly him≈øelf to enquire into things, without re≈øting upon the Judgment of others, that he may obtain a full certainty of the object of his Faith, and the matter of his Precepts. Since that time I re≈øolved only to follow the Holy Scripture, and Rea≈øon, in ≈øuch things in which it ought to ≈øupply the ≈øilence of the Sacred Writings, and to a≈ø≈øure my ≈øelf by tho≈øe two means, of what I was to believe, and to teach others, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the trouble of following the ≈øteps of other Men; never putting Pen to Paper, but to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tho≈øe ≈øubjects, the importance of which I was convinced of, or had not been ≈øufficiently explain'd and examin'd. I have therefore endeavour'd to
<pb facs="tcp:59386:11"/>free, as much as po≈ø≈øible, our Holy Doctrine from ≈øuch errors, as mo≈øt Men appear to me to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with; or at lea≈øt, to ≈øet in order, ≈øuch things whic I conceive to be confu≈øed; Whether I was the fir≈øt that di≈øcover'd it, or whether I needed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to promote what had been begun by others. There are other Rea≈øons that have engag'd me in that de≈øign. For having ≈øworn in the Univer≈øity of <hi>Franeker, faithfully to maintain the pure Doctrine of the Reformed Church, and defend it both by words and writings, in all nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øions;</hi> I may now ≈øay with <hi>Prudentius,</hi> and as it becomes my Age.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:59386:11"/>commonly believed and done, than to be at the trouble of freeing them≈øelves from Errors. In the mean while; what pa≈øt in <hi>Frei≈øeland,</hi> when my fir≈øt Book appear'd abroad, ought to have taught me, how dangerous it is to write upon ≈øuch matters; there being neither favour nor profit to be expected for ≈øuch Authors as rid them≈øelves from all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and having no regard, either for the Credit or Power of the Faction, who≈øe Sentiments they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, re≈øolve to follow only what the Scripture teaches, or Rea≈øon dictates to them, and to embrace no Opinions, but ≈øuch as are founded upon tho≈øe two Grounds. Perhaps after my Death the u≈øeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of this Undertaking will be known; and tho' I dare not hope that it will be done in my Life time; yet I publi≈øh it my ≈øelf, to learn the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publick, to defend my Works, and to enlarge or correct them, according to the Light I may acquire a-new, or that ≈øhall be communicated to me. For methinks, I am more able to do it, and to be Interpreter of my own Words and Thoughts, than tho≈øe that may afterwards adopt my Opinions, and have ≈øome regard for my Memory.</p>
            <p>As for the re≈øt, though my intention and ≈øcope may be plainly perceived by the fir≈øt Chapter; yet I ≈øhall add, that no Men in the World are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any Athei≈øtical Sentiments, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded of the Divinity of the Holy Writ, and more di≈øpo≈øed to render to God the Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to him, than tho≈øe, who as I am, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the common Opinion of the Power and Vertue of the Devil. Whoever ≈øhall read this Book with attention, and without partiality, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be per≈øuaded of it; at lea≈øt, I mean, that there is enough to ≈øatisfie tho≈øe that ab≈øolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Principles of <hi>De≈øcartes,</hi> concerning the u≈øe of Rea≈øon; and at the ≈øame time ≈øuch as give too
<pb facs="tcp:59386:12"/>much extent to tho≈øe Principles; and that tho≈øe two Parties will equally approve of the manner in which I di≈øtingui≈øh Spirits from Bodies, and both from God, without however e≈øtabli≈øhing any thing as to their Operations that cannot be proved by plain and nece≈ø≈øary Inferences. So that I powerfully confute the fooli≈øh Errors of <hi>Spino≈øa,</hi> who confounds God and Nature together. I believe not that there is any Author, who has more ≈øolidly e≈øtabli≈øht the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difference that there is betwixt God and the Creature, and the incon≈øi≈øtency of the Properties of Bodies with tho≈øe of Spirits, then I do here; as was nece≈ø≈øary to be done to lay a firm foundation to this work, that is wholly grounded upon that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, at lea≈øt as to tho≈øe things that are the object of the Light of Rea≈øon. Be≈øides, I have this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ≈øatisfaction, that I confirm by an evident proof the Doctrine of our Churches, that tends ≈øtill to dimini≈øh the Honour paid to the Creatures, in order to increa≈øe that which is due to God. This Book witne≈ø≈øes for me that I ≈øet up the Glory, Power, and Wi≈ødom of the Soveraign Ma≈øter of the World, as much as they had been taken from him, to be communicated to the Devil. I bani≈øh from the Univer≈øe that abominable Creature to chain him in Hell, that <hi>Je≈øus,</hi> our Supream King, may more powerfully and ≈øecurely reign. Though his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that is to endure to the la≈øt day, is likewi≈øe to ≈øub≈øi≈øt in the mid≈øt of his Enemies, that are here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, that is among≈øt the People of the Devil, or ≈øuch in whom Sin keeps ≈øtill imprinted the Image of the Devil. With that intention I am not afraid to explain in my ≈øecond Book ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ly Writ in another Sen≈øe, than they have hitherto been taken: But if by the publi≈øhing of ≈øuch new explications, one aimed not at the Honour of God, and only ≈øought to impair and ≈øtain the Reputation
<pb facs="tcp:59386:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>of tho≈øe that are of contrary Opinion, he ≈øhould take more to heart his own Credit than the Glory of God. As for me, who have formerly been in Opinions contrary to tho≈øe I ≈øpeak of, and which are ≈øtill held by the greate≈øt part of Men; I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly propo≈øe my pre≈øent Sentiments, but only with a ≈øincere intention of glorifying God, and bringing Truth to Light. I think not therefore to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for not ≈øticking to the vulgar explications, I had formerly follow'd, and preferring before them tho≈øe of ≈øome Per≈øons, who have not done what I now ≈øuppo≈øe to be obliged to do. Yet I am not alone in the≈øe Opinions; for they are agreeable to tho≈øe of many others, ≈øome of whom have appear'd in the World even after me. And though they have produced and a≈ø≈øerted in Writing tho≈øe new Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and Tran≈ølations of the Bible, but by way of Exerci≈øes, and to ≈øhew what ≈øubtilty and parts they acquir'd in their Youth, by the alteration of ≈øuch Expo≈øitions as had learned Men for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; yet as for me, methinks that in my old Age I ought to make u≈øe of my own Eyes, and to ≈øpeak with liberty. As for the re≈øt, if there are among≈øt us, who, to multiply the proofs of our Opinion, and dimini≈øh tho≈øe of the contrary Party, ≈øtretch the Holy Scripture too far, that's their own fault, and not ours. We pre≈øume to be provided with better Arms, to dcfend the Fundamental Truths of the Church. But it mu≈øt be ob≈øerv'd as a general fault, that the reading of the Bible is undertaken with a Mind full of its own prejudices, or tho≈øe of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters; and that 'tis generally explain'd according to tho≈øe Notions, without any other Rea≈øon or Ground but that of chance, or of ≈øome ca≈øes that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioned the choice of ≈øuch parts as is then followed. I take the Vail from tho≈øe prejudices, and ≈øhew what Method is to be ob≈øerv'd to undertake the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:59386:13"/>of the Holy Writ, without any prevention. For I hold it for certain, that none would have explain'd ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øages of the ≈øaid Writings as I here treat of, ≈øo as they are u≈øually Interpreted, had he not been imbu'd with a prejudice of the great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of the Devil, or had he not intended to confute ≈øome particular Errors. I have already proofs of it; for ≈øeveral learn'd and pious Per≈øons have very much approv'd of my Method of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho≈øe Texts, and the ≈øearching into their Sen≈øe; and having treated in my Sermons of the chief Points of this ≈øubject, I am inform'd that many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ≈øhew a great impatience to ≈øee my Writings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. I have frequently been in Conver≈øations, where the mo≈øt important matters, e≈øpecially tho≈øe that are contain'd in my ≈øecond and third Book, were di≈øcu≈øs'd, and they ≈øeem'd partly ≈øatisfi'd with my Explications, and in hopes of being fully convinc'd by tho≈øe they expected from me: I refer my ≈øelf to their Judgment, to know whether their expectation has been deceived or fulfill'd; being per≈øuaded that if they do not agree to ≈øome particulars, yet they will approve of my intention, and contribute their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, that the greate≈øt part of the things I propo≈øe may be receiv'd and reli≈øh'd. If I were ≈øo caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to di≈øturb my ≈øelf on account of what may be ≈øaid and believ'd of my de≈øign, and to make more of the number than of the quality of the Readers, I ≈øhould undergo great hard≈øhips: For I doubt not but mo≈øt Men, having little meditated upon this matter, will think that I commit a great Sin in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing this Treati≈øe; not however in reference to the fir≈øt Book, where I only relate the various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the ≈øeveral Nations from very credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, without declaring my own Sentiments, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing tho≈øe of others. Neither do I believe that the two la≈øt parts will be found fault with, but only
<pb facs="tcp:59386:13"/>the ≈øecond, where the mo≈øt important Doctrines are di≈øcu≈øs'd, will rai≈øe ≈øome difficulty, and not plea≈øe every one. It will e≈øpecially ≈øeem ≈øtrange, that I make ≈øo little account of the Devil, and endue him with ≈øuch an incon≈øiderable Power. For matters have been carried ≈øo far, that ≈øome Men think it a piece of Piety to a≈øcribe many Miraculous Effects to the Devil, and to hold for ra≈øh and impious People tho≈øe that cannot believe, that he does what is te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by thou≈øands of Witne≈ø≈øes. If any contradict their Opinion, he is taken for an Athei≈øt, that is, ≈øuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Exi≈øtence of one God, tho' he is only guilty of the Crime of not believing two, <hi>viz.</hi> a good and a bad. But tho≈øe that are of your Mind, de≈øerve them≈øelves to be called <hi>Dithei≈øts,</hi> or ≈øuch as believe two Gods: [as the <hi>Arians</hi>] got the name of <hi>Trithei≈øts,</hi> becau≈øe they believ'd three Gods [of different nature.] If any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to put a new name upon me, in reference to my Opinions, I willingly yield to that of <hi>Monothei≈øts,</hi> that is, who believes but one God, and one Saviour <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt;</hi> upon who≈øe words I wholly tru≈øt, where he ≈øays, <hi>Fear not them who kills the Body, but fear him who can de≈øtroy both Soul and Body,</hi> Mat. 10.28. I fear him much le≈øs, who has no power either over Body or Soul, and trouble not more my head with the judgments of tho≈øe Judg 6.13. <hi>In the name of the Lord the God of ho≈øts,</hi> I encounter that <hi>Goliah;</hi> let's ≈øee who will lend him a helping hand!

<pb facs="tcp:59386:14"/>end, before he makes his objections. By tho≈øe means he ≈øhall perfectly know whether tho≈øe particular and private places which he has read, and with which he had not been ≈øatisfyd, have afterwards been explain'd, and made worthier of his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the concatenation of the whole Treati≈øe, and the rea≈øons contain'd in it: For it would be trouble≈øome to view and examine again, all the places of my An≈øwers I would quote. So that it mu≈øt not be take ill, if I give none to tho≈øe that ≈øhall follow another Method, and would make me wa≈øte with them the time that can be better ≈øpent.</p>

               <hi>AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE Whole Work;</hi> What hath been the de≈øign of the Author, and what is his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</head>
            <p>AS the two fir≈øt Books of this work that I publi≈øhed at fir≈øt, have been differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for Rea≈øons alledg'd in the Preface; It will not be ami≈øs to repre≈øent to the Reader, what has been properly my de≈øign in the≈øe four Books, that I have Intituled, <hi>The World Bewitch'd,</hi> nor to ≈øhew what foundation I built upon, and what way I take to find out the truth. For alth√¥ I expre≈øs my ≈øelf clearly enough in the beginning of the work, and in the Preface to the fir≈øt part; I know neverthele≈øs, that is not ≈øufficient to de≈øtroy the prejudice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the learned them≈øelves appear more bia≈ø≈øed than the Vulgar; which I ≈øhould never have thought; but it ≈øeems at pre≈øent, I have found out the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:15"/>which is, that the mo≈øt part of tho≈øe which do not put them≈øelves to the trouble to pa≈øs through all the Degrees of the Schools, a≈øpire to Sciences and ≈øublime knowledge, but for their particular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure; they are the People that love liberty, and to whom it matters not, who is the Ma≈øter that in≈øtructs them, provided that they may learn ≈øomething; or if they are greedy of rarities, they have not ≈øo much re≈øpect to the mode, nor to that which is New or Antient, as to the beauty of the matter, and to that of the work. On the contrary, it is with tho≈øe who pa≈øs through the Schools, as with tho≈øe who live in Shops, where every one has his way, every Ma≈øter has his Method in the work he makes. In one Town they make the ≈øame things after one fa≈øhion, and in another, after another; when one is taken up with the mode, he often rejects what is plea≈øing, without any other Rea≈øon, then becau≈øe it is not as commonly u≈øed in the World. And we have a ≈øtrangene≈øs for all novelties, ≈øo long as they have not the common vogue; alth√¥ otherwi≈øe, we might approve them, and have them cheap enough; but as ≈øoon as Cu≈øtom has introduced them, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ≈øeek them out, and to be di≈øgu≈øted at the former. Sciences are ≈øubject to the ≈øame inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. Tho≈øe that we ≈øend to the Schools, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the road which has been mark'd out to them for their exerci≈øes; they endeavour to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves upon the model of tho≈øe which have mo≈øt reputation, or of tho≈øe who are the neare≈øt to their fir≈øt prejudices; ≈øo this is di≈øapproving the part they have taken, not to be apt to take any, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve our own liberty, and thus we expo≈øe our ≈øelves very much; but one runs a greater risk, if will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a≈øcend higher, and ≈øearch things in their Fountains, it happens at la≈øt, that we find our ≈øelves out of the ordinary Road, and that we are
<pb facs="tcp:59386:15"/>obliged to take another. <hi>Hinc illae lachymae, From thence proceeds all di≈øorders.</hi>

            <p>The common Opinion of the Devil, of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, power, and Operations, and of People which are accu≈øed of having commerce with him, began by little and little to become very ≈øu≈øpitious by the help of natural light, which I have common with others, which was ≈øtrengthened and purified by the Scripture; ≈øo after I had well examined it, I was in doubt, whether I ought to maintain it any longer, or abandon it, not only by Rea≈øon of the truth, but al≈øo becau≈øe of the Piety which it ≈øeem'd to contradict: My Con≈øcience it ≈øelf compel'd me to it; for I was obliged to an≈øwer tho≈øe that ask'd me, and to take care of my Conduct, becau≈øe of the di≈øpo≈øition I ≈øaw the People in. It was the Duty of my charge, and every Day occa≈øions offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, my pain increa≈øed every moment, by the continual nece≈ø≈øity I found my ≈øelf in, to ≈øpeak and act as others did, or to oppo≈øe the publick with words or actions, which agree not with my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which is to be complai≈øant, and to agree with all the World, as much as is po≈ø≈øible. Be≈øides I found not as yet foundation enough to act after an other manner, which made me at fir≈øt re≈øolve to make an exact ≈øearch, after the Original of this common and general Opinion, to know whether it was founded upon truth. But becau≈øe I make this examination, <hi>√† priore</hi> and not <hi>√† po≈øteriore,</hi> as they in the Schools, I have propo≈øed the ≈øtate of the Que≈øtion, but at the end of the fir≈øt Book; where I di≈øcovered in the 22th Chapter, how many of the Opinions, which I have related; (which are all tho≈øe that ever were in the World upon this ≈øubject,) The Prote≈øtants have at la≈øt got together, and formed tho≈øe which they retain to this Day.

            <div type="part">
               <head>An Abridgement of the Fir≈øt Book.</head>
               <p n="1">IN the Fir≈øt Book I run over all the World, to find whence this Opinion has its Original. And for this purpo≈øe I have omitted neither time nor place. I ob≈øerve that the ≈øubject ought to be examin'd in two Re≈øpects; In re≈øpect of the Devil, to find what is his Knowledge and Power; and in re≈øpect of Men, to ≈øee what they learn and effect by his means. But becau≈øe the≈øe things are preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, or are ≈øo thought to be, and that by con≈øequence they are known only to God, I have judg'd it nece≈ø≈øary, to know what are the Opinions of Men concerning the Divinity, and Spirits in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, either good or bad, and of human Souls ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Bodies by death, which are al≈øo Spirits: I make a ≈øearch of all the≈øe things, Fir≈øt, in the Books of the Ancients, and afterwards in the Moderns of all Religions, and among≈øt all Nations, di≈øtingui≈øhing them into <hi>Pagans, Jews, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> in reference to the pre≈øent ≈øtate of the World. I begin with the Ancient <hi>Pagans,</hi> which are for the mo≈øt part <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> known to us by <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Books they have le≈øt us: which I treat of in the 2d, 3d, and 4th Chapters; for there are very few Hi≈øtories of other Countries and other People, which are come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There you ≈øee what they believe touching Gods, and Spirits, which are neither Gods nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:59386:17"/>Souls; and as to the e≈øtate of the Souls after death: You read there al≈øo what means they u≈øed to attain that knowledge, and to operate things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Nature, by the means of tho≈øe Spirits, ≈øuch as they believe them to be. I come afterwards down to our time, and examine all the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the World; fir≈øt in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the 6th, <hi>Chapter;</hi> after in <hi>A≈øin,</hi> in the 7th and 8th <hi>Chapters;</hi> then in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the 9th <hi>Chapter</hi> and at la≈øt in <hi>America,</hi> in the 10th <hi>Chapter;</hi> which gives me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to demon≈øtrate in the 11th <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as well Ancient as Modern, have had a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divinity, that is all powerful, but that they have a≈ø≈øociated to him, inferior Gods. That the Greeks have often called them Demons, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe Gods, as mo≈øt of the Pagans do at this Day; which Demons, or inferior Gods, have every one their ≈øhare in the Admini≈øtration of the Univer≈øe, directing the affairs of Men under the name and Authority of the Soveraign God, and being as Mediators between him and Men: They conver≈øe al≈øo with the≈øe la≈øt, who can, by their means, know and effect things above the power of Nature. This knowledge gives ≈øome the name of Diviners, and the≈øe Operations cau≈øe others to be called Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Sorcerers; in con≈øequence of which, all the effects that we cannot give a Rea≈øon for, or find the cau≈øe of, are attributed to the≈øe Demons or inferior Gods,</p>
               <p>The Souls of the Dead are al≈øo ranked among≈øt the Demons, and according as they have behav'd them≈øelves well or ill upon Earth, the good or evil which happens to Men, is attributed to one or the other. It is that which has given occa≈øion to di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh the inferior Gods, into good and bad.</p>
               <p>After the Pagans, which know neither the true God nor Religion; I treat of tho≈øe which have the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:59386:18"/>Scripture among them, of whom the fir≈øt are the Jews, having known God a long time before all the others, and received his Word in the writings of the Old Te≈øtament, where they have learned, that in truth the Souls of Men are immortal, but that there are no Demons, or inferior Gods, ≈øuch as the Pagans fancy. That God alone by him≈øelf rules the Univer≈øe, and that none can have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or produce effects beyond the ≈øtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that belongs to God only. I ob≈øerve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Judai≈øm in the ≈øtate into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øibly fallen, ≈øince the coming of Chri≈øt, and as it is at this Day, is very much mixed with Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øm, or at lea≈øt very much infected with it; whence proceeds the practices of Divinations and Sorcery, that are in fa≈øhion among≈øt the Jews, <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the 13th.</p>
               <p>After that I repre≈øent, that the Mahometans who acknowledge but one God, and created Angels good and bad, and the Devil as chief of them. That the Mahometans, I ≈øay, who have admitted the Books of the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> and reverence Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt as a great Prophet, have neverthele≈øs mixed in all their Opinions, a great many of tho≈øe of the Pagans, which they have for the mo≈øt part received, and that they are no le≈øs inclined to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations and Witchcraft, <hi>Chapter</hi> the 14th.</p>
               <p>After the Jews and the Mahometans, who keep a kind of mean between the Pagans and the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; I pa≈øs to the≈øe la≈øt, and di≈øtingui≈øh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time, before Popery, under Popery, and ≈øince Popery. By this means I ≈øhow, that the primitive Chri≈øtians ≈øince the Apo≈øtles, have in≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly introduced among≈øt them, many Opinions of Pagani≈øm and Judai≈øm, which have been increa≈øing under Popery till they attained to the heighe≈øt pitch, and that they had a≈øcribed to the Angels, the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Souls of the decea≈øed, e≈øpecially to the Devil, all the Miracles which the Pagans attributed to the Demons, the Devils, and inferior Gods, <hi>Chapter</hi> the 15th to the 21.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, I take notice, that among the Ancient Chri≈øtians, there aro≈øe a Sect called the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which had admitted in particular a great many Pagan Opinions, and made the Devil almo≈øt equal to God. And I ≈øhow, that their Opinions have in≈øen≈øibly been propagated, in Chri≈øtianity, even to our times; after that I come to the≈øe la≈øt Ages, and to the Doctrines of the Prote≈øtant Churches, among which I rank all tho≈øe that are Call'd <hi>The Reformed,</hi> that is, all tho≈øe that are ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Popery; upon which I remark, that the more we are remote from Pagani≈øm, either for time or place, there's the le≈øs credit given to all tho≈øe things which re≈øpect the Devil and his Power. Neverthele≈øs I ≈øhow, that part of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not having comprehended enough, what are the foundations of the Prote≈øtant Doctrine, nor in what it differs from Popery, are taken with the common Opinion of Devils, to whom as well as to Men, that have Communication with him, they attribute more ea≈øily ≈øo many marvelous effects, and ≈øo much above the power of nature, then others do, who have more meditated and reflected upon tho≈øe Doctrines and variations. <hi>Chapter</hi> the 22th and 23.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly having compared all the≈øe Opinions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I conclude that the common Opinion which has been in reque≈øt among≈øt us to this day, had it's Original from Pagani≈øm, not that the meer u≈øe of Rea≈øon ≈øhould produce ≈øuch thoughts, but on the contrary, the ill u≈øe that is made of it. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we ≈øuffer our ≈øelves to be ≈øeduced, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a fal≈øe appearance of Piety, without having recour≈øe to the light of the Scripture, that we fall
<pb facs="tcp:59386:19"/>into ≈øuch Extravagancies, with which we are plea≈øed, and love to continue in them. I prove that the≈øe are thoughts that never were in≈øpired to the Chri≈øtians by the Holy Scripture, by rea≈øon that tho≈øe who read it le≈øs, and under≈øtand it le≈øs, give more Credit to the≈øe ≈øort of things, and becau≈øe all the World is already prevented before they read it, and meditate upon it.</p>
               <p>For by the≈øe Rea≈øons I endeavour to bring the Reader to con≈øider, whether the Scripture gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to believe all tho≈øe things that are ordinarily ≈øaid upon that ≈øubject, or to believe them ≈øo as they are ≈øaid; or whether ≈øuch Sentiments have not taken root in us from our tender Youth, and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Cu≈øtom. At be≈øt, I have a very ≈øtrong pre≈øumption for that Rea≈øoning, that when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before-hand, that ≈øuch a thing is, there is a great di≈øpo≈øition to turn our Rea≈øon, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions of the Scripture to that ≈øide, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the inclination we have of it comes from Rea≈øon, and even the Holy Writ leading us thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Moreover, we receive the fir≈øt Interpretations, and the Commentaries upon the Scripture, from the hands of tho≈øe antient Doctors, touching which I prove, Chap. 15. that they have been all prejudiced, ≈øome more, others le≈øs, in favour of many Pagan Doctrines and Opinions, which have unawares given occa≈øion to that Sen≈øe in which the Scripture has been expounded by them. The≈øe are the Contents of the 24th Chapters, and the conclu≈øion of the fir≈øt Book.</p>

This application is become ≈øo familiar to Divines, that it has been received as an undeniable maxime, ≈øince <hi>Philo</hi> took a fancy to propo≈øe it.</p>
               <p>It is however a truth, that rea≈øon ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Scripture, becau≈øe the latter pre≈øuppo≈øes the former; I under≈øtand ≈øound rea≈øon, to which the Scripture ought to pre≈øent it ≈øelf, and make it ≈øelf known as divine; after that, Rea≈øon comes to the help of Scripture, teaching us things wherein Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ≈øilent, and the Scripture likewi≈øe comes to a≈ø≈øi≈øt rea≈øon, di≈øcovering to us things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, and above the reach of our under≈øtanding. We mu≈øt neverthele≈øs confe≈øs, that the Scripture is above rea≈øon, not as mi≈øtre≈øs, for they have every one their particular Empire and Direction: But as being more noble and excellent; becau≈øe it is in this God manife≈øts to us, things which no humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding ever could comprehend, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2.9. notwith≈øtanding it happens ≈øometimes that they meet both in the ≈øame way, where they lodge together in the ≈øame hou≈øe, and by con≈øequence they often lend one another the helping hand, but they do it freely, alth√¥ with this difference, that rea≈øon as an inferiour, alwayes ≈øhows a great re≈øpect for the Holy writ. When therefore 'tis ≈øaid a Chri≈øtian ought to ≈øubmit his under≈øtanding to the word of God; it mu≈øt be under≈øtood, the under≈øtanding ≈øuch as it is in the E≈øtate of corruption, ob≈øcure by he Clouds that ≈øurround it, and infected by the ≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:59386:21"/>things which are above our reach, which are only manife≈øted to us in the word of God; and which we are obliged to believe as Scripture di≈øcovers them, alth√¥ we comprehend them not. But it does not follow from thence, that we ought to believe tho≈øe things, ≈øuch as men teach us by their expo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or even by their tran≈ølations, without a great certainty that they are faithful. So then the word of God con≈øidered as it is originally, and in it ≈øelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God without any re≈øpect to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations that have been made by men; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon not ≈øuch as is born with us, and when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd with prejudices, and blinded with pa≈ø≈øions, but rea≈øon purified by the ≈øame Spirit which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired the Scriptures; the Scripture I ≈øay and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, are the two only lawful and true grounds of the knowledge we can acquire, as well in things Natural as Spiritual.</p>
               <p>But there is yet another di≈øtinction to be made upon this Subject, that is, that rea≈øon is the ground and rule of our knowledge in natural things, ≈øince the Holy writ never treats of them purpo≈øely to in≈øtruct us, and di≈øcover them to us, and that it ≈øpeaks of them only as of ≈øubjects; the nature of which is known to us as much as is nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make a good u≈øe of them, as well in civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as in Spiritual. In what concerns our Salvation, the word of God is the only ground of our Faith, and the rule of our Life without being in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our rea≈øon, to add, to take from, or to change any thing in it, th√¥ it ought to be employed on this occa≈øion, in two manners; the fir≈øt is to try the Scriptures that are ≈øaid to be divine, in making u≈øe of the knowledge that Men have naturally of God, to know whether the Scriptures pre≈øent to them, ≈øuch Characters of truth as are agreeable to that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ≈øecond is, to comprehend by the ≈øen≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:59386:22"/>of the word contained in them, the doctrines there propo≈øed for our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Further we mu≈øt be per≈øuaded, that Scripture and Rea≈øon are mutually helping, to one another, in ≈øuch matters as are of their Juri≈ødiction; for if the Scripture ≈øpeaks not ≈øometimes naturally of things naural; Neverthele≈øs as it never propo≈øes any thing fal≈øe, tis the part of rea≈øon to in≈øtructus, after what n anner the Holywrit mu≈øt be under≈øtood in the≈øe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according as the matter required; as <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 19. touching the de≈øcription of the cour≈øe of the Sun, and in many other like places. Or if there be any thing in nature, that our proper experience has not ≈øufficiently di≈øcover'd to us to pa≈øs a ≈øafe Judgment, and that we be obliged to rely upon the Credit of others, who perhaps are not much more knowing than our≈øelves: The Scripture may al≈øo in this occa≈øion afford us ≈øome light; As in what is ≈øaid of the Rain, <hi>In the Evening and the Morning in Judea, Jeremiah</hi> 6.24. the little rain that falls in that Country in the time of Harve≈øt, and the few ≈øtorms that are ≈øeen there, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17. of the violence of the Ea≈øt wind upon the coa≈øt of <hi>A≈øia</hi> and <hi>Pale≈øtine</hi> in the Medite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea, <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 48.8. and the like. But that which is mo≈øt con≈øiderable is, that the Scripture it ≈øelf in≈øtructs us of ≈øome certain natural things, to which the reach of rea≈øon ≈øhould never attain, they are ≈øo much above it. Such is the beginning of the World, e≈øpecially that of Man, by the immediate creation of God out of nothing. And ≈øuch is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the darkne≈øs and corruption in which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and under≈øtanding is plunged, as they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the help of ≈øuch ≈øound and pure remained light, as is in them.</p>
               <p>The≈øe are the general Principles I pre≈øuppo≈øe, which I believe to be ≈øuch, that there is no Body, in what particular Sen≈øe he may be, that will conte≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:59386:22"/>them. Upon which I come to examine what is true in all the relations I have faithfully made in my fir≈øt Book, and which are the Sentiments, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Di≈øcour≈øes of all Men upon that ≈øubject. But it is manife≈øt, that I have not made to my ≈øelf any particular Principles; and much le≈øs put Rea≈øon and Philo≈øophy above Scripture: Even the contrary will be ≈øeen as clear as the Noon-Day, if you take the trouble to read my Writings with attention, and without Prejudice: For I ob≈øerve as to this re≈øpect, as well as in reference to Comets, (in which Treati≈øe I have followed the ≈øame order, of which I am ama≈øed it has not been perceived) the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion ought to be di≈øcu≈øs'd of one ≈øide with relation to Nature, and on the other with reference to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ; and therefore I begin with Rea≈øon, which is inferiour to the two others, to ≈øearch into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in the lowe≈øt School, what it teaches mo≈øt pure touching God and Spirits, and particularly the Devil. For ≈øince the Pagans have pre≈øumed to ≈øay ≈øo many things of the Demons, that they had not learned of the Scripture, of which they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it ≈øeems to me that I am not in the wrong to examine what there was that was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Rea≈øon; and of what Opinions it ≈øeems to be the principle, or what are tho≈øe that are derived from another ≈øour≈øe. But as what I could di≈øcover by the deepe≈øt and mo≈øt exact ≈øearch I could make in that lowe≈øt School, is yet but incon≈øiderable; I a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend a degree higher, where I find a Mi≈øtre≈øs ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to this fir≈øt, that is, the Scripture, that I begin to con≈øult in the 8th Chapter of the ≈øecond part. Now as in the ≈øeven fir≈øt Chapters, where I walk as in Nature alone, I lay a≈øide Scripture to try how far human Under≈øtanding may attain by its own ≈øtrength; ≈øo I leave rea≈øon behind, as ≈øoon

Rea≈øon may act alone without Scripture, in things that are of its Juri≈ødiction, for Arts and Sciences are the objects of Rea≈øon: From thence they proceed, and thereby they are learned, that is, Man u≈øes his own light for that purpo≈øe, without having recour≈øe to the in≈øtructions of the Word of God, and without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occa≈øion for them. But for the things of an higher Nature, which concern the Will of God, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Salvation of Man, the Scripture is the true principle and ≈øolid foundation upon which our tru≈øt is founded; although Rea≈øon ought to concur with it, to under≈øtand and comprehend under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Spirit of God, the Sen≈øe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So in this ≈øecond examination of the ≈øecond part, where the certainty of the knowledge which proceeds from Scripture alone is treated of, I am neverthele≈øs obliged to employ my Rea≈øon, to the end it may ≈øerve me to examine what Scripture contains; not that it may reach ≈øo far as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the things them≈øelves; but it ought neverthele≈øs to comprehend what the Scripture it ≈øelf ≈øays, and that things are ≈øuch as it ≈øays, although I conceive them not ≈øuch as they are.</p>

If there is the lea≈øt appearance that we may, by wre≈øting the Scripture, adapt it to the Sen≈øe we would have it, we never fail to do all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in order thereto, and afterwards imagine to have found there ≈øufficient proofs in favour of our Opinion, becau≈øe it ≈øeems to ≈øay what we de≈øire<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> As we ≈øee two Coun≈øellors explain the ≈øame Law, each for the advantage of his Client; and that they never want Rea≈øons on both ≈øides to confute the contrary Arguments; ≈øo that they appear each to have the right on his ≈øide; and that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to extricate what they have ≈øo much perplexed.</p>
               <p>But it is ≈øaid, that I my ≈øelf do what I condemn in others; and for me, I maintain that tho≈øe, who are con≈øcious of their guilt and worthy of cen≈øure, ca≈øt that imputation upon me, ≈øeeing me explain ≈øo many pa≈ø≈øages in another Sen≈øe than that with which they are prevented, without any other Rea≈øon than becau≈øe it is ordinarily received. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded that this change proceeds in me from the ≈øame cau≈øe that I di≈øcover in them. See the true cau≈øe that makes them ≈øay I wre≈øt the Scripture; not that I really wre≈øt it, but rather that I keep not as a Slave to their Interpretations. But I make, ≈øay they, a fal≈øe Suppo≈øition, and after I endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:24"/>to give to the Scripture a Sen≈øe which agrees to that Suppo≈øition; That may be, but to know what it is, you mu≈øt examine after what manner I make the expo≈øition of the Scripture; and whether I turn it towards my prejudices; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Principle, they ≈øay, I ≈øuppo≈øe is, that a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot act upon a Body, nor upon other imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirits.

It is a prejudice that pa≈ø≈øes from hand to hand from one party to another: It in≈øen≈øibly ≈øpreads it ≈øelf in all the Minds, and in that Di≈øpo≈øition the reading of my Book is undertaken: but they ≈øeldom read it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, from one end to the other, as it would be but ju≈øt and nece≈ø≈øary to do; they only read ≈øome ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate places, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe they are referr'd to, and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially tho≈øe in which I di≈øpute upon the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Spirits: For I may boldly ≈øay, that of tho≈øe that have read my Book with attention, I find but very few which hold the ≈øame Di≈øcour≈øes: On the contrary, they take quite another party, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Truth.

I begin with the di≈øtinction of names, in fixing at fir≈øt, what mu≈øt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by a Body, and a Spirit, to avoid all equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: which I have done in the fir≈øt Chapter. I ≈øpeak of God in the Second, proveing not only, that the ≈øupream Being which I denote by that word, is only one, but al≈øo that there is not the lea≈øt communion between it and created things; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly confuting the Opinion of <hi>Spino≈øa,</hi> upon this ≈øubject; which I pretend to do with more force and evidence than any hitherto, becau≈øe ordinarily they undertake to demon≈øtrate by the mo≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and incomprehen≈øible E≈ø≈øence of God, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and virtue of the Operations of created Spirits, which I ab≈øolutely reject, as a way which is u≈øed to lead us into error. By con≈øequence I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the arguments which are taken from the nature of God, to demon≈øtrate in what manner acts a Spirit which is his creature, and has nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with him, but the name. After, in the Third Chapter, I prove by arguments drawn from the ≈øovereign perfection of God, that there are none of tho≈øe ≈øorts of Spirits, that the Pagans e≈øteem to be Gods and ediators of Men towards the ≈øupream Divinity; becau≈øe the Rea≈øons of tho≈øe that ground that belief upon the perfection of God, are directly oppo≈øite to this perfection.</p>
               <p>We then having taken off the imaginary Spirits, I come to tho≈øe which we certainly know to exi≈øt; that is, our Souls that are a part of our ≈øelves, and which by con≈øequence, are better known to us by
<pb facs="tcp:59386:25"/>our own experience; this is treated of in the fourth Chapter, where I prove as much as is po≈ø≈øible their immortality, and that they ≈øub≈øi≈øt even out of the body: I employ for this purpo≈øe, Rea≈øon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becau≈øe they are two ways, that equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to the knowledge of the Soul; the fir≈øt by experience and by our own Con≈øciou≈øne≈øs; and the ≈øecond by the particular in≈øtructions God gives us of the e≈øtate of the Soul, after this life: but I quote not the Scripture in this part of my Treati≈øe, where I examine but what concerns nature only. Neither do I judge it nece≈ø≈øary to do it afterwards, becau≈øe it is a point that a Chri≈øtian looks upon, as already ≈øufficiently e≈øtabli≈øhed; and ≈øuppo≈øes it when he will engage in a di≈øpute upon this ≈øubject. Be≈øides, I reject as ≈øuper≈øtitions and fables, whatever, proceeds from the invention of Men, e≈øpecially of the Heathens, which is the matter of the fifth Chapter. So we come to know with certainty, that ≈øuch a Spirit, that is the Soul which truly exi≈øts, has a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with which it lives, and without which it may ≈øtill live, and to reject all the other Spirits, of whom the greate≈øt part of the World fal≈øly believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence. But be≈øides tho≈øe Pagan Opinions, we hear every day mention made of Angels, not only by Chri≈øtians, but al≈øo by Jews and Mahometans. The Que≈øtion is, Whether Rea≈øon alone is capable to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, that there are ≈øuch Spirits, de≈øtitute of a proper and peculiar body? Upon this point I ≈øhew in the ≈øixth Chapter, that our under≈øtanding without the help of Scripture, cannot penetrate far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to comprehend, that it is po≈ø≈øible, but not certain, that there are Spirits. For this Rea≈øon, I have not judg'd it nece≈ø≈øary, to examine the Operations of the≈øe Spirits upon bodies, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other Spirits; becau≈øe it ≈øeems to me ridiculous to trouble ones ≈øelf with the examination of the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:26"/>Operations of Creatures, the exi≈øtence of which is not e≈øtabli≈øhed as certain. And therefore I have ≈øpoken in the fir≈øt Edition, but by the way in ver≈øe, which is at pre≈øent, the ≈øeventh Sect. of the ≈øixth Chapter. And therefore it is manife≈øt how wrongfully many People would per≈øwade them≈øelves, that I have compo≈øed my work only, <hi>To deny the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirits upon bodies, and upon other Spirits.</hi> And be≈øides, that I ground upon this negative, all my explications of the pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture; but that I may avoid this per≈øecution for the future, I thought fit to in≈øert in the new Edition that is made of my Book, a whole Chapter between the ≈øixth and ≈øeventh, ≈øo that this new Chapter is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent the ≈øeventh, and the ≈øeventh is the eight, and ≈øo of the others following. There I pretend clearly to ≈øhew, that the proofs related upon that ≈øubject, ≈øtrike not at all to the end, and cannot be con≈øidered as true proofs; which I mean as to what concerns nature, and as to what Human Rea≈øon may conceive of it ≈øelf, as de≈øtitute of help from the word of God.</p>
               <p>After that I come to the word of God, and then I employ Rea≈øon no more, but keep to the Scripture only and I ≈øearch in it, what it will teach me, touching Spirits, which is now the que≈øtion; there I find that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Angels, it gives us to under≈øtand, ≈øuch Spirits as are the Mini≈øters of God, toward other Creatures. But there is nothing di≈øcovered to us, touching their E≈ø≈øence; neither is their any thing in the Hi≈øtory of the Creation, as to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, or the manner of their fall; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, part of them was from the beginning rejected from God; notwith≈øtanding, the Scripture puts the≈øe two things for certain, which is the ≈øubject of the eight and ninth Chapters.</p>
               <p>I con≈øider afterwards the properties and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Scripture attributes to them, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:26"/>to know, what is their proper nature, their power upon other Creatures, either ≈øpiritual or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. But the pa≈ø≈øages that ≈øpeak of the≈øe things do not appear to me to have been under≈øtood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, than tho≈øe that attribute al≈øo to certain Men, that is, to Prophets and Apo≈øtles, the works that they have done in di≈øpen≈øing the miracles of God. That which gives me occa≈øion to ≈øay, that as this di≈øpen≈øation ≈øurpa≈ø≈øes the force of tho≈øe to whom it was entru≈øted, it cannot make us know what was their proper nature, whence I take occa≈øion to infer the ≈øame things touching Angels; this is in the tenth and eleventh Chapters.</p>
               <p>That which could not be di≈øcovered by the means of the name, Original, or Operation of tho≈øe Spirits, I endeavour to learn by the means of their orders, of which is made an ample men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the twelfth, fifteenth, and nineteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my fir≈øt Book. But I draw not any light from thence, ≈øave that Angels, as well good as bad, have each their head; that the Prince of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is called <hi>Michael,</hi> and that of the bad, named <hi>Diabolus,</hi> the Devil; that is in the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Yet I leave it not here; I con≈øider again, that the Scripture attributes in many places, ≈øome particular admini≈øtration to Angels, I examined to know what it is, fir≈øt as to the good Angels in general, in the thirteenth Chapter, whom the Scripture often makes appear, and always for particular revelations to the faithful, either to work extraordinary miracles, or execute God's Judgments upon Men by puni≈øhments, or by deliverances. But I conceive not that what is ≈øaid of this Mini≈øtry, is different from what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of that of tho≈øe holy Men, who have been employed in the works of God and his miracles, that they in no wi≈øe operated by their own virtue;
<pb facs="tcp:59386:27"/>by con≈øequence I find nothing as yet which may give me a certain knowledge of the proper Angels, their power, or their Operations.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I come to a more particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the principle pa≈ø≈øages, e≈øpecially of the manner of ≈øpeaking of the≈øe three per≈øons, which appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the two others that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Lot, Gene≈øis,</hi> Chapter the eighteenth and nineteenth: and in making reflection upon this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory, and comparing it with other in≈øtructions of the Holy Scriptures; It ≈øeems to me, that I am in the right to conclude, that tho≈øe Angels, that is to ≈øay, tho≈øe Me≈ø≈øengers, were Men as they named them≈øelves; not being able in the mean while, to determine what mu≈øt be under≈øtood by the Angel of the Face of God, which conducted <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in the de≈øert, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23 <hi>Chap.</hi> and by the Angels, by whom God gave his Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> I propo≈øe only my thoughts, and what ≈øeems to me may be under≈øtood by it, by a Collation of the pa≈ø≈øages of the Holy writ, which make mention of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that Divine conduct of the I≈øraelites, in the de≈øert, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>I pa≈øs farther and examine what is ≈øaid in the Scripture concerning the Angels, with relation to ≈øome certain Per≈øons, Nations, and Countries: And I conclude from thence, that what has ever been variou≈øly written upon this ≈øubject by particular Authors, is not founded upon Scripture, becau≈øe all the pa≈ø≈øages made u≈øe of to ground tho≈øe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ≈øpeak but figuratively.</p>
               <p>At la≈øt coming to the Devil, and to the re≈øt of evil Angels, I ≈øee that this name has been given as well to ill Men, as to evil Spirits, and even fir≈øt to wicked Men. So I examine in the 17, 18 and 19 <hi>Chapters,</hi> what may mo≈øt conveniently be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by the <hi>Chief of evil Spirits;</hi> but in making
<pb facs="tcp:59386:27"/>the examination of all the particular pa≈ø≈øages which are u≈øually applied to the Devil, I find that the name of <hi>Satan</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> is u≈øed in ≈øome of the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, and that of <hi>Daemon</hi> and of <hi>Daemonium</hi> in ≈øome others. And that there are ≈øeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ordinarily applied to the Devil, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to double my cares, that I may di≈øcover what ought to be under≈øtood by <hi>Devil,</hi> e≈øpecially in the Hi≈øtory of the fall of the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in that of the temptation of the ≈øecond. This is the matter of the 20 and the 21≈øt, <hi>Chapters.</hi> The other pa≈ø≈øages which contain the name of <hi>Satan,</hi> appear to me to be different from the≈øe, of which I treat in the 23, 24 and 25 <hi>Chapters.</hi> I examine after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the 26 to the 30, what are the <hi>Daemonia,</hi> and tho≈øe that are called <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈øt.</hi> And la≈øtly, in the 31≈øt, <hi>Chapter,</hi> what mu≈øt be under≈øtood in all the other pa≈ø≈øages, where in≈øtead of the name of <hi>Devil,</hi> and of <hi>Demons,</hi> others quite different are u≈øed.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the principal operations attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Devil in Scripture, con≈øi≈øt in the fall of the Fir≈øt Man, and the a≈ø≈øaults he made upon our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the De≈øart; Thence I take occa≈øion to examine, Whether tho≈øe Accounts may ≈øerve to the Opinion of the power of this evil Spirit, and of the power of his operation upon Men? But it ≈øeems to me, that in the narration of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fall of Man, that happen'd by the di≈øcour≈øe of a Serpent, nothing is ≈øaid that ought to carry me to conclude, that the Devil him≈øelf can act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Soul and Body of Man. Here I keep to that di≈øcovery, without going any further. Tho≈øe that are of another Opinion, find that this conclu≈øion is drawn from that Relation, with a full evidence, and aske how the fall of Man could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwi≈øe; rendring them≈øelves guilty of the ≈øame fault they reproach me with, by pretending
<pb facs="tcp:59386:28"/>to know them≈øelves, how the thing came to pa≈øs, and to be able to render the rea≈øon of it. But he that judges, ought not to ≈øpeak of it ≈øo po≈øitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declaring he knows nothing of it, and finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing revealed upon that point, he is pre≈øently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed of denying the ≈øame thing it ≈øelf, and of not believing the matter of Fact, becau≈øe he grants he is not acquainted with the manner of it. The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Voetius</hi> has however, explained him≈øelf upon this ≈øubject very near, as I do, for in the <hi>fir≈øt part of his Di≈øputes, pag.</hi> 915. ≈øpeaking of the fall of Man, he ≈øays, <hi>upon the Que≈øtion, to know how, and in what manner? it is not po≈ø≈øible to give ≈øo ≈øatisfactory an an≈øwer; but it may be ≈øeen that there remains ≈øtill ≈øomething, which the weakne≈øs of our under≈øtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, nor likewi≈øe how the Devil ≈øeduced</hi> Eve.</p>
               <p>Examining the temptation of our Lord by the Devil, I agree that the Tempter is the evil Spirit; and I believe that the literal Sen≈øe may very well pa≈øs, ≈øuppo≈øing that it was a wicked Man ≈øo called. But I ≈øhew, that under≈øtanding the≈øe words of the evil Spirit, literally; the quite contrary may be inferr'd from what is ordinarily gather'd from thence. Thereupon, if I be ask'd how I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand and explain that narration? I an≈øwer, That I believe that the thing was done in a Vi≈øion. See how <hi>Schultetus</hi> ≈øpeaks, who as well as <hi>Voetius,</hi> has been a member of the national Synod of <hi>Dordrecht:</hi> in his <hi>Exercit. Evang. Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. the que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to know, <hi>whether the thing really happend, or in a vi≈øion?</hi> he an≈øwers, <hi>it was in a vi≈øion,</hi> and after gives ≈øome rea≈øons, which however I do not judge ≈øo ≈øtrong as mine. None has right to require from me, that I ≈øhould preci≈øely explain my ≈øelf upon the pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture, and upon others: from which they ≈øuppo≈øe to draw ≈øtrong proofs in favour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:28"/>of that Opinion, the truth of which I here call in que≈øtion; nor that I ≈øhould declare what ≈øen≈øe I give them, e≈øpecially to tho≈øe who mention the fall of the fir≈øt Man in Paradi≈øe, and the temptation of our Lord in the De≈øart. For I have had no other de≈øign on this occa≈øion, but to examine whether the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, under≈øtood according to the Letter, afford ≈øufficient proof to make us admit the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that are u≈øually drawn from thence, and to e≈øtabli≈øh the common Opinion which is had of the craft and power of the Devil to act upon Men. If it were nece≈ø≈øary to proceed farther, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages to the bottom, in order to penetrate their true ≈øen≈øe, a whole Book ≈øcarce ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. I refu≈øe not however to do it, and hope to undertake it, as ≈øoon as the Divine Providence will furni≈øh me with occa≈øion and lei≈øure.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhew, as to other pa≈ø≈øages of the Holy Writ, that they cannot be under≈øtood of evil Spirits, but only of ill Men; and of the works of God, not of tho≈øe of the Devil; th√¥ without he≈øitating, the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages are ordinarily applyed to the Devil. I maintain in the 22 <hi>Chapter,</hi> that it was a Man which brought <hi>David</hi> to number the People, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. that the pa≈ø≈øage, wherein the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> again≈øt the Devil, is mention'd, is very ob≈øcure, and that there is a great uncertainty in the pre≈øent Opinions upon that point, as all Divines grant; and that by con≈øequence, nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from them, e≈øpecially if it be ≈øuppo≈øed, as ≈øome learned do, that the Devil was but a meer Man. I ≈øhew in <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. That the Spirit of <hi>Python</hi> that is ≈øpoken of in the 16th <hi>Chapter of the Acts of the Apo≈øtles,</hi> can no ways be applied to the Devil. Neither does the famous Hi≈øtory of <hi>Job,</hi> always alledged one of the fir≈øt, as a proof of his power, being well examined in its whole extent, attribute
<pb facs="tcp:59386:29"/>to him the lea≈øt part in the evils, which by the Providence of God, happen'd to that Holy Man. As to the Angel of Satan which tormented <hi>St. Paul,</hi> I place him in the ≈øame rank with the fight again≈øt <hi>Michael,</hi> that is in uncertainty, there being no ground to pretend to a perfect under≈øtanding of this pa≈ø≈øage; and therefore I look upon it as in≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove any thing which is the matter of the 25th <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the Po≈ø≈øe≈øt are univer≈øally alledg'd for a certain proof of the great power of the Devil, and that we read ≈øo many times in Scripture, that the evil Spirits have been ca≈øt out by our <hi>Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> I be≈ølow five <hi>Chapters</hi> upon examining what is in it. I ≈øee that the term of <hi>Diabolus,</hi> which we Tran≈ølate <hi>Devil,</hi> is not found in any of the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages in which tho≈øe Relations are contained; but only that of <hi>Daemon,</hi> which I illu≈øtrate in the 26th <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the 27th I ≈øhew, that the mo≈øt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous di≈øea≈øes, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of the Head, were u≈øually a≈øcribed to <hi>Demons,</hi> or even call'd by the name of <hi>Demons;</hi> and in the 28th, that our <hi>Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> has not changed the u≈øual way of ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but made u≈øe of them according to the cu≈øtom of that time; neither did he always immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute all the errors, in the 29th and 30th <hi>Chapters;</hi> ≈øo that the cure of <hi>Daemonia,</hi> was not properly an expul≈øion of Devils, but a miraculous cure of incurable Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>I come after to other pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture, where neither the names of <hi>Devil, Satan,</hi> or <hi>Demon</hi> are made u≈øe of, but tho≈øe of the <hi>Prince of the World, Prince of the power of the air; Prince of this Age, of Lord≈øhips, Powers, Dominions,</hi> and the like; And I ≈øhew that there is not the lea≈øt cau≈øe to apply them to the Devil; but that the Stile of Scripture leads us of it ≈øelf to under≈øtand by all the≈øe names a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order of per≈øons.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:29"/>
               <p>Having then examined all, I could not conclude, that the Scripture, con≈øidered truely and without prejudice, attributes to the Devil this power and the≈øe operations, which the prevention of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Tran≈ølators di≈øcovers in it: I grant it has been very trouble≈øom to me to be obliged to take this party, and to confute and cen≈øure very famous Men and mo≈øt approved interpreters: It even ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that I expo≈øed my ≈øelf very much becau≈øe I know that a more advantageous opinion is had of tho≈øe that are not known, and that a Prophet is neither e≈øteemed in his own time nor in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For this Rea≈øon I did fir≈øt re≈øolve not to meddle with tho≈øe of Scripture, where I found my ≈øelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain'd to go from the expo≈øitions ordinarily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But at la≈øt, con≈øidering that my work would appear but imperfect, and that they would not fail to object tho≈øe famous pa≈ø≈øages, to which I ≈øhould be then obliged to an≈øwer; I at la≈øt prevailed with my ≈øelf to venture in the main Sea, and to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none that came to attack me; further I do not believe that any one can ≈øhew me, that the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I make, are founded upon the light of rea≈øon and humane under≈øtanding, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular propo≈øition I ≈øhould have a≈ø≈øerted; ≈øuch as this is ≈øaid to be, that a Spirit cannot act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a body, nor upon other Spirits I have made u≈øe of for this effect, but of the ordinary means that the knowledge of Languages afford us; ≈øo there is no more unju≈øt accu≈øation then that which is rai≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again≈øt me upon this ≈øubject.</p>
               <p>And therefore when I compare with the analogy of the whole Scripture, with the grounds of our Divinity, and with the rules of true Piety; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ordinarily publi≈øhed concerning the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of the Devil, his power, his operations, his apparitions in divers places in the World, his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:30"/>and the Kingdom which he rai≈øes again≈øt that of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; I conclude not only that they are not grounded upon the≈øe three principles, but al≈øo being con≈øidered with all the nece≈ø≈øary attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they appear contrary to them. In this place I begin to enter into di≈øpute, and to draw my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion from arguments which the Scripture and rea≈øon furni≈øhes me with; having by the means heretofore e≈øtabli≈øhed upon tho≈øe two principles, ≈øearched after the ways how plainly and without equivocation to under≈øtand the ≈øtate of the que≈øtions which properly and particularly cocern the Devil. This is not then the point in que≈øtion, to di≈øpute of the meaning of tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages which mention the fall of Man, or ≈øpeak of Angels, ≈øome of whom appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others wre≈øtled with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> or of the tentation of Our Lord Chri≈øt in the de≈øert; nor of the ≈øen≈øe of tho≈øe that ≈øay <hi>David</hi> was tempted by <hi>Satan,</hi> and that <hi>Job</hi> was tormented by him, and the like places; but the Chief point, the ≈øcope of all this ≈øearch, is to know what to believe concerning the Devil.</p>
               <p>Upon this I be≈øtow the five la≈øt Chapters, and in the three fir≈øt of the≈øe five, which are the 32th, 33th, and 34th, I am not afraid of calling Rea≈øon to my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; after having ≈øhewn that the Scripture is ≈øilent upon this ≈øubject, for I pre≈øume to have made appear in the 32th Chapter, that the apparitions of Evil Spirits are contrary to true Rea≈øon, and that the Holy Scripture affords no proofs of it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the 33th Chapter, I ≈øhow, that the knowledge that the Devil may have, as well of things Natural as Civil, and above all of things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, which concern our Salvation, is nothing of what is believed. I re≈øt as yet upon the ≈øame foundation of Scripture and Rea≈øon, to prove the Empire of the Devil is but a Chimera, and that he
<pb facs="tcp:59386:30"/>has neither ≈øuch a Power, nor ≈øuch an Admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is ordinarily a≈øcribed to him, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 34th Chapter. At la≈øt, after having treated of all tho≈øe things with all po≈ø≈øible exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, I come to the conclu≈øion of my ≈øecond Book, where I ≈øhew the importance of this examination by rea≈øon of the great value the vulgar put upon the Devil, and his Operations in the World. My Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that the≈øe ≈øorts of Di≈øcour≈øes ≈øhake the Grounds of the Doctrine of our Salvation, and cau≈øe a great damage to Piety in divers occa≈øions. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate the fir≈øt. of the≈øe things in the 35th Chapter, and the ≈øecond in the 36th.</p>
               <p>As to the Doctrine, I prove in this place what I have a≈ø≈øerted in the fir≈øt Chapter of my Book, <hi>viz.</hi> that the common Opinion concerning the Devil is oppo≈øite to the proofs that <hi>Jehova</hi> is God, and that <hi>Je≈øus</hi> is the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> and that the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apo≈øtles are the Word of God. In what concerns Piety, I ≈øhew, that the Service of God is thereby greatly weakened; that the Filial fear is very much dimini≈øhed by that they have of the Devil; that the e≈øteem that the holy Angels de≈øerve, is almo≈øt de≈øtroyed, that the glory and virtue of the miracles of our Saviour Je≈øus, are very much le≈ø≈øened, that the vanity of Man is maintained and increa≈øed; and that the comfort of the humble is cut off, or at lea≈øt, ≈øuffers a great diminution. That is whatever is contained in my ≈øecond Book.</p>

               <p>After having thus ≈øimply treated of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Spirits, and particularly the Devil, according to the knowledge that ≈øound Rea≈øon can furni≈øh us
<pb facs="tcp:59386:31"/>with, according to that which may be drawn from the word of God, where Rea≈øon cea≈øes; I pa≈øs ≈øtill following the order and divi≈øion e≈øtabli≈øhed in my fir≈øt Book,) to tho≈øe Men, who, according to the common ≈øentiment, have communication with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, e≈øpecially with the Devil. The ≈øame order to which I have kept in my ≈øecond Book, is al≈øo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved in this; for in the eight fir≈øt Chapters, <hi>I</hi> make an exact ≈øcrutiny of all which may contribute to clear the ≈øubject I treat of, and afterwards in the ≈øeven la≈øt, I ≈øhew what light the inquiry has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and how far one can rely upon what I have di≈øcovered.</p>
               <p>I propo≈øe at fir≈øt the true ≈øtate of the que≈øtion, ≈øhewing that the query is not, Whether Magick is po≈ø≈øible, for I grant it; but whether there is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which by the virtue of agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and the Devil, may di≈øcover hidden things, predict tho≈øe that are to come, and produce effects above the force of nature. This is di≈øcu≈øt in the fir≈øt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Following the di≈øtinction that I have already heretofore many times ≈øet down, I make in the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Chapters, the ≈øearch required, and that fir≈øt by the light of Rea≈øon; which I divide it into two parts: in the fir≈øt, I examine, whether it be po≈ø≈øible to conceive that Men have any commerce with Spirits; that the one and the other may rely upon mutual help, or that they may act one upon another, In the ≈øecond part, I examine whether there is Rea≈øon to believe, that there may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs compacts between them; that they may mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contract, and reciprocally perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Covenants. I expre≈øly deny the fir≈øt of the≈øe, founded upon the Rea≈øons alledged, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and I unfold a little more preci≈øely in the 2 Chapter of this, what is contained in the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:31"/>fir≈øt, which I defend again≈øt the arguments of <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil an Engli≈øh Author.</hi> I be≈øtow the third Chapter upon confuting tho≈øe compacts of the Magicians with the Devil, as ridiculous and altogether incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and I an≈øwer at the ≈øame time, ≈øeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and ≈øhifts of <hi>Glanvil,</hi> convincing him by his own Rea≈øons that are ≈øufficient for that purpo≈øe. I pa≈øs afterwards to the Scripture, as to an upper School; from the 4th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the 7th, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it over from the beginning to the end, to find out with the utmo≈øt exactne≈øs, what it di≈øcovers to us upon this point, and upon all it's dependencies either by it's expre≈ø≈øions, or by the examples it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us. Than I begin to e≈øtabli≈øh what we may believe of it according to Scripture.</p>
               <p>As an Introduction to this examination, I relate all the names it gives to that ≈øort of People, to their trade and art, and I compare the difference to be found between the tran≈ølations of our own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well as between the tran≈ølation of others.</p>
               <p>This examination is but general, but afterwards I come to particulars, whether the Scripture ≈øpeaks of that ≈øort of People, of their trade and arts, ≈øo as it is ordinarily ≈øuppo≈øed. This I do from the fifth Chapter to the 12th, but finding it expre≈ø≈øes not it ≈øelf as they give out, I examine what ≈øort of People they can be, and what the Scripture really ≈øays of them, from the 13 <hi>Chap.</hi> to the 17th.</p>
               <p>I di≈øcu≈øs the fir≈øt of the≈øe, as well by Scripture as Rea≈øon, and proceed by degrees; ≈øearching, fir≈øt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the≈øe of whom the Scripture ≈øpeaks, have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular communication with the Devil; whether they make their predictions and enchantments by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking or by his power; and at la≈øt whether they have between them covenants for that purpo≈øe. The pa≈ø≈øages of Scripture which I examine upon
<pb facs="tcp:59386:32"/>this ≈øubject, are of three ≈øorts, ≈øome contain Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that kind of People, and of their Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts which I ≈øhow in the 5th 6th and 7th <hi>Chapters, viz.</hi> In the 5th all the enchantments of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> in the 6th, tho≈øe of <hi>Bil≈øa,</hi> tho≈øe of the Prie≈øts of the Phili≈øtins, and of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and many others, by whom the idolatrous Kings of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> fell into great Sins, e≈øpecially when they came to the Court of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and in the 7th Chapter, the enchantment of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Elimas,</hi> who are called enchantors; tho≈øe of the maid ≈øervant which was in the Town of <hi>Philippi,</hi> who had a Spirit of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> and tho≈øe of the ≈øeven Brothers Exorci≈øts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I come to the examination of the names, of words, of actions, and circum≈øtances, as well by them≈øelves as comparing the Dutch tran≈ølations of the Scripture, with tho≈øe which have been made in divers Languages, by different Tran≈ølators, and by comparing with the texts, the explications which are given by ≈øo many different interpreters. All the pa≈ø≈øages where tho≈øe things are contained, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined very attentively, give cau≈øe to conclude, that the Magicians or Enchanters have been very mi≈øcheivous People, who≈øe Doctrine and morals were very much corrupted; but they do not furni≈øh any probable argument to a≈ø≈øert, that the≈øe People had a particular communication with the Devil.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond Order of the pa≈ø≈øages of the Holy Writ upon this ≈øubject, con≈øi≈øts of tho≈øe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the expre≈øs Laws, which condemn that ≈øort of People, and forbid them the exerci≈øe of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which I examine in the 8th and 9th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But I find no other Rea≈øons for tho≈øe Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions and the puni≈øhments inflicted upon them, but their Idolatry and Cheats, both of which are Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and not becoming the People of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:32"/>
               <p>The third Order con≈øi≈øts in tho≈øe Rea≈øonings and Proverbial Expre≈ø≈øions, di≈øper≈øed through the whole Scripture, that have relation to tho≈øe things, either to the Per≈øons them≈øelves, or to their ways. I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine therefore whether nothing can be under≈øtood in tho≈øe places, whence ≈øome con≈øequence may be drawn to illu≈øtrate the ≈øubject in hand: But having be≈øtowed the whole tenth Chapter upon it, I find nothing more than before.</p>
               <p>Now as in the third Chapter, I have examined by the light of Rea≈øon, whether there is cau≈øe to believe the po≈ø≈øibility of the communication of Men with the Devil by expre≈øs Covenants, I do here the ≈øame by that of the <hi>Holy Writ.</hi> For in the two following Chapters I run it over again, and in≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all the pa≈ø≈øages, where the lea≈øt mention is made of Alliances, or Compacts, that are not made with God but again≈øt Him, ≈øinfully and with an evil de≈øign; I find not ≈øo much as one that ≈øpeaks of tho≈øe Agreements made with the Devil, or any thing like it. Upon this I be≈øtow the 11th Chapter. In the 12th I run over again the whole Scripture from the beginning to the end; From the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to our Saviour, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether from whatever has been ≈øaid upon that ≈øubject, there is any occa≈øion to infer, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may likewi≈øe on his part make his dete≈øtable Compacts; I demon≈øtrate, that the Opinion, which ≈øuppo≈øes ≈øuch Contracts between the Devil and Men, by vertue of which they are ≈øaid to have perform'd all their Witchcrafts, can by no means con≈øi≈øt with what is contained in the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> nor with the Di≈øpen≈øation of God's Covenant, as well before the Law as under the Law, and much le≈øs under the Go≈øpel.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:33"/>
               <p>Thus I plainly ≈øhew, that the vulgar Opinion of Magick, and of its Dependencies, by no means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Sacred Writings, but on the contrary is altogether oppo≈øed to it. Afterwards we mu≈øt con≈øider what the Scripture ≈øays concerning tho≈øe that practi≈øe that Art, and what Te≈øtimony it gives of their Actions. This I do two ways, in the five following Chapters. The fir≈øt by offering, in the 13th and 14th, the lively Picture which the <hi>Holy Writ</hi> gives of tho≈øe Men in ≈øeveral places; and the ≈øecond by ≈øhowing what Opinion mu≈øt be had of them according to the Character given them.</p>
               <p>But expounding to the Reader the force of tho≈øe things, I make yet this di≈øtinction: That I fir≈øt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Per≈øons to his view, that he may know what might be expected from them; what their aim may be; why they were interrogated; and on what the great Men and the vulgar be≈øtow their time. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the 14th Chapter, I con≈øider them in them≈øelves, with their Arts and Crafts, ≈øhowing the Rea≈øons that moved the People, e≈øpecially the Kings, even tho≈øe of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> to be infatuated by them.</p>
               <p>Afterwards 'tis required to know what Judgment mu≈øt be made of them, according to the <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> which I ≈øhow in the three following Chapters. In the 15th, I a≈ø≈øert, that in whatever they did, they ≈øhewed neither real Power nor Virtue; that they knew nothing of what they ventur'd to foretel, or to di≈øcover as very much concealed; and that in reality they effected nothing of what they boa≈øted of, or of what they undertook to effect; but that they applied them≈øelves to deceive by outward ≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, wherein con≈øi≈øted the chief part of their Art. In the mean while, as the Holy Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ms, by its Expre≈ø≈øions in ≈øome places, to a≈øcribe
<pb facs="tcp:59386:33"/>a great vertue to Conjurations and Enchantments; I examine in the 16th Chapter, what is the Sen≈øe of tho≈øe places, and I conclude that after an attentive Meditation it will not be found that it ≈øays upon that ≈øubject what it appears at fir≈øt to ≈øay.</p>
               <p>All the≈øe things being thus enquired into, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to ≈øhow wherein properly con≈øi≈øts all the Evil; why tho≈øe Men with their Arts, e≈øpecially the <hi>I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> that had a hand in their Crafts, are ≈øo defamed in the Bible; why, ≈øince that time they have been in as great hatred among≈øt Chri≈øtians, who have mortally dete≈øted them, and puni≈øhed them with the utmo≈øt rigour; And la≈øtly, for what Rea≈øon the Laws have been ≈øo ≈øevere again≈øt them, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their Arts, as well under the Old Te≈øtament as under the New. This is the Enquiry of the 17th Chapter. I have hitherto ≈øpoken only of tho≈øe who pretend to a Conver≈øe with the Devil, and to be in a Covenant with him; I add in this place a Chapter, which is the 18th, where I mention tho≈øe to whom he is an Enemy, who≈øe Mind is ≈øuppo≈øed to be troubled, or their Body to be tormented by him; tho≈øe are the po≈ø≈øe≈øt, as they are ordinarily call'd, but I enlarge not much upon that ≈øubject, having already fully clear'd it in my ≈øecond Book, from the 26th Chapter to the 30th, where it came to pa≈øs.</p>
               <p>Having thus ended the fir≈øt part of my third Book, I ≈øhow what Judgment mu≈øt be made of all tho≈øe things, which I con≈øider in two Re≈øpects. Fir≈øt, I e≈øtabli≈øh from the 19th to the 20th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what may rationally be thought of it; and in the la≈øt Chapter, I ≈øhow what is the Duty of a Chri≈øtian, and how he ought to behave him≈øelf in ≈øuch occa≈øions.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:34"/>
               <p>A double judgment may be formed upon this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Fir≈øt, concluding that the Vulgar Opinion is altogether groundle≈øs and condemnable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the 19th, 20th, and 22th Chapters. Secondly, By e≈øtabli≈øhing what mu≈øt be held of it.</p>
               <p>Concerning that fir≈øt and common Opinion; As in the Writings made again≈øt my ≈øecond Book, ≈øome expre≈ø≈øions of our Liturgy have been objected, I ≈øhow in the 19th Chapter, how weak are the Grounds upon which are founded the principal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who≈øe Doctrines are in ≈øhort in <hi>Voetius;</hi> and that the Proofs they alledge are not taken from the Sen≈øe of the Holy Writ, well examined and ≈øearcht into; but only from the external ≈øound of Words, if I may ≈øo ≈øpeak, upon which we are wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt, as well as upon the Idea's that fir≈øt offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to us, when we con≈øider them but ≈øuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. To which I add, that Liturgies mu≈øt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood in the Sen≈øe of the Scripture from whence they are drawn, and to which they relate in all tho≈øe places, where 'tis ≈øpoken of the Temptations and Seductions of the Devil, Spiritual Combats, Witchcraft, Predictions, Enchantments, and even in all others where the agreeablene≈øs of Style, and the Series of Idea's has cau≈øed ≈øomething to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ≈øeems to have a relation to it. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in the 20th Chapter, I demon≈øtrate, that the Errors ≈øpread among≈øt the vulgar concerning the Works of the Devil, and his Adherents, are ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely oppo≈øite to the ≈øame Liturgies; even ≈øo far, that among≈øt the Doctors of the Reformed Church, none but tho≈øe that are of my Opinion can pretend to conform in this point to what they ≈øub≈øcribed when they took Orders; which I under≈øtand only as to the Doctrine and Truth. I ≈øhow again, in the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>21th Chapter, that this Opinion makes very bold attempts upon Piety; that it dimini≈øhes the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to God, that it extreamly weakens Faith and Charity, and that it expo≈øes Chri≈øtianity to the attacks of the Unfaithful, and that it cau≈øes great di≈øtractions and prophanations in our Prayers.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, I proceed further and to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, I di≈øcover in the 22th <hi>Chapter,</hi> what mu≈øt be believed of all the≈øe things, and in the 23th I declare what mu≈øt be done. But as in the 32th <hi>Chapter of the</hi> 2d <hi>Book,</hi> I have treated of apparitions in general, I ≈øpeak here of pre≈øages and predictions in particular, examining what is po≈ø≈øible or not, as to the≈øe things, and to what cau≈øes they mu≈øt be a≈øcribed. The≈øe cau≈øes, according to the Proofs I have related in this place, are natural, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil meddles not with them: I propo≈øe my thoughts in the ≈øame manner upon the Conjuring up of Gho≈øts, the divinations of the pretended Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and all ≈øorts of apparitions and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, which are ≈øaid to be cau≈øed by their malice, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the compacts they have contracted with the Devil; and la≈øtly I ≈øhow what ≈øort of Magick is practicable in the World and which is not.</p>
               <p>I declare in the <hi>la≈øt Chapter but one,</hi> what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mu≈øt be had of tho≈øe men that credit Apparitions and Witchcrafts; And ≈øtick not however to conver≈øe with tho≈øe that meddle with tho≈øe dete≈øtable Arts; And in the <hi>la≈øt Chapter,</hi> what is our Duty, and how we are obliged to behave our ≈øelves in that re≈øpect. We mu≈øt double our devotion and veneration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, our moderation and charity towards our Neighbours, our mode≈øty in our actions, and our zeal in the exerci≈øes of Piety. Such are the Contents of the 3d <hi>Book.</hi>

               <head>An Abridgment of the 4th Book.</head>
               <p>There would be rea≈øon to believe that this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is exhau≈øted; but it ≈øeems experience carrys it above Rea≈øon; and being grounded upon matters of fact and in≈øtances, it ≈øeems that it will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us: Our Adver≈øaries appeal to its Tribunal, and plead their cau≈øe with ≈øo many ≈øtrong and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating rea≈øons, that it ≈øeems they de≈øign to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us by their multitude. This con≈øideration obliges me to add this 4th <hi>Book</hi> to the 3 preceding, and to examine what experience actually teaches, that it may be no more objected, that by my new Doctrine, I undertake to contradict opinions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and e≈øtabli≈øhed through all the World; where almo≈øt no place is to be found, but it affords plain in≈øtance of the operations of the Devil; of which I dare even deny the po≈ø≈øibility. I di≈øtingui≈øh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho≈øe In≈øtances into tho≈øe, that any one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his own experience, and into tho≈øe that are grounded upon the relation of others; there's no doubt but what one has experienc'd him≈øelf, mu≈øt prevail over all the re≈øt. But to omit nothing, I fir≈øt ≈øhow how far one may tru≈øt to his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and afterwards how far we may rely upon the te≈øtimony of others. I di≈ømi≈øs the fir≈øt of the≈øe que≈øtions, in the <hi>fir≈øt eleven Chapters;</hi> and he Second in the 21 following, adding two others at the end as a conclu≈øion of the whole.</p>
               <p>I di≈øtingui≈øh again each of tho≈øe parts into two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; having thought convenient to ground upon many examples; the in≈øtructions and illu≈øtrations I give upon both, that no body may ea≈øily be deceiv'd. What I e≈øtabli≈øh as to the fir≈øt part is contained
<pb facs="tcp:59386:35"/>from the <hi>beginning of the 5th Chapter,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are the matter of the following Chapter to the 11th: But I could not ≈øo exactly follow the ≈øame method in the 2d part, having thought nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, or at lea≈øt u≈øeful, in ≈øome places, to mix with examples the illu≈øtrations I give at fir≈øt, and with the illu≈øtrations, the in≈øtances I produce afterwards.</p>
               <p>I therefore ≈øhow in the fir≈øt part, that there are few Men among≈øt us, that are capable of pa≈ø≈øing a ≈øolid Judgment upon that ≈øort of things, and that be≈øides that our occa≈øions will not allow either to examine, or to ≈øearch into whatever could be nece≈ø≈øary, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a naked and full knowledge of all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact. I a≈øcribe the fir≈øt of the≈øe faults, to the prejudices with which we are imbued, or to the terror with which we are ≈øurprized, at the ≈øight and hearing of what pa≈ø≈øes. This is the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the fir≈øt Chapter: I demon≈øtrate in the 2d, that this cau≈øe al≈øo proceeds, from that we know not ≈øufficiently how far the ≈øtrength of nature may extend its operations: In the 3d <hi>Chapter</hi> I a≈ø≈øert, that we know not more of the things, the Images of which nature may only ≈øhow us, when they are not real, nor we ≈øo far knowing as to ob≈øerve all the tricks of men; nor of ≈øufficient Authority to ob≈øerve all the circum≈øtances of their Actions: I ≈øay again, we are not Skilful enough to penetrate the Force and Virtue of Arts, which encrea≈øe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the exerci≈øe we make of them, and of the care we take to cultivate them, and make us look upon meer natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:59386:36"/>be told, before we have examined them with a full exactne≈øs, and made experiments upon all tho≈øe ca≈øes and in≈øtances, the truth of which is propo≈øed to us as undeniable.</p>
               <p>That I may, if po≈ø≈øible, leave no perplexity, on darkne≈øs in my work; I make yet a di≈øtinction upon this la≈øt point. For I propo≈øe in four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all the In≈øtances I have been obliged to in≈øert in ≈øeveral places of my Fir≈øt Book, to facilitate the under≈øtanding of the things contained in it, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with tho≈øe that concern the Ancient Heathens that are in the Third Chapter of that Book, and in the Thirteenth of this.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe that relate to the Modern Pagans, in the 6th, 8th, 9th and 10th Chapters of the Firk Book, are contained here in the 14th. Tho≈øe that I have drawn from the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tof the 15th, and tho≈øe that were afforded me by the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> in the 19th, 20th, and 21≈øt, of the Fir≈øt Book, are confuted in the 16th of this.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I run over the whole Univer≈øe, from the 17th to the 32d <hi>Chapter,</hi> relating and examining the mo≈øt famous examples, and tho≈øe that are thought to be the ≈øtronge≈øt proofs for the common Opinion. I alledge fir≈øt in general, tho≈øe that are mo≈øt ordinary and familiar, concerning Apparitions and Magick. Such are the Apparitions of the <hi>Fairys,</hi> that were ≈øo much talked of in our Country, as the <hi>Fairy of Ro≈øemberg,</hi> and the like, in the 17th Chapter. In the 18th I ≈øpeak of tho≈øe that pretend to be invulnerable to Sword and Mu≈øquet-Ball, and I prove that all the Di≈øcour≈øes and Narrations made upon that ≈øubject, are altogether fal≈øe. I come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to examine particular Relations. And Fir≈øt, of tho≈øe that can have no particular name, or properly be called Apparitions, Divination, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft;
<pb facs="tcp:59386:37"/>or Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; becau≈øe they are made up of ≈øeveral kinds of Witchery, of which Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion u≈øes to be the Principal. This is the matter of the 19th and 20th Chapters. In the 21≈øt, I pa≈øs to Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in the 22 to Divinations; and afterwards to Witchcraft, from the 24th to the 32 Chapters.</p>
               <p>I relate but Three In≈øtances of the Fir≈øt ≈øort. The Fir≈øt, is the going out of the Children of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>elon</hi> in 1284. The Second, is the Devil <hi>Zechariah,</hi> whom <hi>Vol≈øcius</hi> mentions in his <hi>Hi≈øtory of the Churches of Sclavonia,</hi> which In≈øtance I expound in the 19th <hi>Chapter,</hi> as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of whatever may be invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or practis'd as to this. The Third is, the ≈øtory which happen'd Twelve years ago at <hi>Bol≈øward,</hi> that was publi≈øhed with very extraordinary circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: I relate it in the 20th Chapter.</p>
               <p>I come afterwards to ≈øuch Ca≈øes as have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reference to Apparitions and Witchcraft, or enchantments, if there be any ≈øuch. Of the Fir≈øt kind, I produce <hi>the famous Devil of</hi> Ma≈øcon; And having taken off the vail from the Cheat, I deal in the ≈øame manner with <hi>the Spirit of</hi> Tedworth, that was lately brought again upon the Stage to frighten me. The Que≈øtion is, Whether they have ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that De≈øign? of which, the Reader ≈øhall be able to judge by the 21≈øt Chapter. He will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe find in the 22, a full de≈øcription of the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øm that appeared a year ago at <hi>St. Aneberg;</hi> and of another Story which happen'd the la≈øt Summer at <hi>Lauzanne,</hi> contained in a Letter, written with the hand of a Mini≈øter of that Town, whom they would trouble with it, which I think ≈øufficient to ≈øhew what Opinion mu≈øt be had of <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øms.</hi> But as to <hi>Divination,</hi> there occurs the mo≈øt ≈øingular and ingenious Story which I ever heard of, that happen'd whil≈øt I was writing this Treati≈øe; and having begun at <hi>Lyons</hi> a Year ago, is ≈øtill in
<pb facs="tcp:59386:37"/>force to this Day. It concerns a <hi>Man,</hi> who by the motion of a <hi>Wand,</hi> he carryed in his hand, boa≈øts of di≈øcovering ≈øprings of Water, hidden Gold and Silver, Robbers and Murtherers. I give a ≈øhort account of the different relations made of it, with the judgments of the learned that are all contrary to one another, and I examine what may be thought of it after a ≈øerious con≈øideration,</p>
               <p>But before I ≈øpeak of Magick, I examine in the 23 <hi>Chapter,</hi> ≈øuch proofs as are drawn from the very confe≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe that are detained Pri≈øoners, as guilty of that crime; and I demon≈øtrate, that nothing in the World is le≈øs worthy of credit, than ≈øuch confe≈ø≈øions. Thence I take occa≈øion to examine the proceedings and enquiries of the Judges that take notice of it, and ≈øhow their nullity and inju≈øtice.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I come to the chief proofs, that have been alledged for Magick, either far or near, long ago or lately; and begin with a ca≈øe which happened within the walls of our City of <hi>Am≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in the hou≈øe of the Orphans about the Year 1570, whil≈øt the Inhabitants profe≈øt as yet, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh Religion, to which I add another ≈øtory, which happened at <hi>Hoorn,</hi> in 1670, with that of <hi>Antoinette Bourignon,</hi> which ≈øhe has related her ≈øelf; all the circum≈øtances of it having happened in her ≈øight at the Ho≈øpital of <hi>l'I≈øle.</hi> In the 24th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I ≈øhow what judgment mu≈øt be made of ≈øuch ≈øtories. In the 25th I ≈øpeak of that Woman of <hi>Abbekerk,</hi> that thrice publi≈øht, ≈øhe was become miraculou≈øly with Child; and has been held not long ago every where for a famous Magician, in the Years 1658 and 1659.</p>
               <p>From that ≈øort of People that are only look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Magicians by the Vulgar, I come to tho≈øe that have been condemn'd for ≈øuch, by the ≈øentence of Judges, and by con≈øequence put to Death. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:59386:38"/>not ≈øuch as have been ≈øet down by <hi>Schottus,</hi> and ≈øome other Authors, becau≈øe it would be to no purpo≈øe, ≈øince they may be ≈øeen in their writings. I only relate ≈øuch new in≈øtances as are come into my knowledge, that I may leave no room to obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor be charged of having pa≈øt by ≈øuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact as might have perplex'd me, and to which I had nothing to reply. For that Rea≈øon, I fir≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what happened in our own Country, from the very time of the Reformation, and mention in the 26th <hi>Chap.</hi> the Hi≈øtory of tho≈øe that have been burnt here for Magick, as one at <hi>Schoonhove,</hi> and 4 at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>tretch;</hi> as al≈øo another ≈øtory, of one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accu≈øed of the ≈øame crime, had been condemn'd to the Rack, by the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> and was acquitted by the ≈øupream Council. This happened in the Years, 1591, 1592, and 1593. Thence I go over to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in the 27th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I make an examination of that black Art that was ≈øaid to be practi≈øed 80 Years ago, at <hi>Kogen</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> a Province of that Kingdom. I likewi≈øe examine all the other particular events, worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that happened in that Country, and were publi≈øhed ≈øeveral times in the Dani≈øh Tongue, and from that tran≈ølated into Latin and Dutch. To which I add a ≈øtory of another unhappy wretch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted this very Year. From thence I go over to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in the 29th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I relate what is in≈øerted in the Royal Records, concerning that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Magick that began to appear in 1669, and again in 1670; and a third time in 1674, to which I add another ≈øentence delivered to me by a per≈øon that ≈øaw the execution of it, at <hi>Golnaw</hi> in <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I afterwards mention the Magick practi≈øed in the <hi>We≈øt of England,</hi> the fal≈øehood of which I di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb facs="tcp:59386:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>my ≈øelf, and gave the Hi≈øtory of it to the publick. This is the matter of the 30th <hi>Chapter.</hi> The 31th contains a judicial information made at <hi>Harlingen,</hi> with a letter written to me upon that ≈øubject from <hi>Leuwarden,</hi> which contains ≈øeveral other matters of fact concerning Magick, happen'd about the Years 1667, and 1668. I conclude this Chapter with the relation of a ca≈øe that happened in the City of <hi>Am≈øterdam</hi> 7 Months ago, which has been lately communicated to me, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it having been di≈øcovered whil≈øt I was writing this 4th part.</p>
               <p>Some People may ≈øuppo≈øe it u≈øele≈øs to add narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a le≈øs con≈øequence, after having ≈øhown the groundl≈øene≈øs and delu≈øions of more con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable facts, But I thought, that in reference to the Vulgar, it was convenient to add here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chapter,</hi> that is the 32th, where I relate the <hi>Story of a Child in Friezeland,</hi> it was ≈øuppo≈øed to be bewitch'd, of which I have had a full account by the letters of his friends and relations; that by this ≈øpecimen any one may judge of all the narrations of that nature, that are ≈øo much credited by the common People; who take ≈øuch matters of fact for undeniable effects of Magick. As for the re≈øt, ≈øhould I make an enquiry after all the examples that are reported to prove the Operations of the Devil, I ≈øhould never compa≈øs my end. And therefore I per≈øwade my ≈øelf, that I have alledged a ≈øufficient number of them to ≈øatisfy the Reader, who ≈øhall not be able to doubt of their truth; becau≈øe I have produced ≈øuch as are mo≈øt known, lately happened, and in neighbouring places; or at lea≈øt attended with one of tho≈øe 3 circum≈øtances, and con≈øequently may be examined with great conveniency and certainty, and te≈øtified for the mo≈øt part, by living per≈øons.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:39"/>
               <p>Thus I put an end to this Treati≈øe, and make my conclu≈øion, briefly rehear≈øing all the proofs related in the 4 Books, each in it's place. The≈øe proofs ≈øhow that there are no natural Rea≈øons, nor Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the Holy Writ, no certain experiments, that give us cau≈øe to a≈øcribe to wicked Spirits, all the Operations and effects that are generally ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to proceed from the Devil or from Men, his Confederates. This is contained in the 33th <hi>Chapter,</hi> whereupon it mu≈øt be remembred, that what I ≈øay concerns only the common Doctrine and Opinion. Afterwards 'tis not difficult to ≈øhow, how wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ≈øuch a ≈øuper≈øtition is cheri≈øhed and increa≈øed, in≈øtead of moderating it, or even rooting it out, if po≈ø≈øible. In the 34th Chapter, I charge with that fault, Clergy Men and Divines, more than Princes and Magi≈øtrates; becau≈øe the former are more particularly obliged to meditate upon tho≈øe matters, to watch over the pre≈øervation of the Souls committed to their care, and to attempt the cure of a Di≈øea≈øe that is ≈øo contagious, and feeds upon the very Bowels.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe 'tis probable, that this undertaking will but ≈ølowly proceed, I will in the mean while propo≈øe to the Reader and my ≈øelf, the le≈ø≈øon of the Apo≈øtle in his fir≈øt Epi≈øtle to <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reject prophane, and Old Wives Fables, and exerci≈øe they ≈øelf to Godline≈øs.</hi> I ≈øhow, in the 35th and la≈øt Chapter, that this is what I chiefly intend in this work, and that I obtain my end in mo≈øt of tho≈øe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Rending of it, with ≈øuitable di≈øpo≈øitions. Be≈øides I hold it for certain, that tho≈øe who take occa≈øion or pretence from thence, to accu≈øe me with error and libertini≈øm, are Men them≈øelves that have not for the word of God, all the deference that could be wi≈øht. This I demon≈øtrate in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>with ≈øo great evidence, that I have already had the ≈øatisfaction to ≈øee that my work produeed a great fruit, when but one half of it appeared. So that I hope by the ble≈ø≈øing of God, it being now fini≈øhed, I ≈øhall gather as plentiful a Harve≈øt, as the ≈øorrows which it cau≈øed to my Enemies, whil≈øt I was publi≈øhing it, were unea≈øy and ≈ømarting.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Importance, Nece≈ø≈øity, and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øefulne≈øs of this Matter, and in what Order it ought to be treated of.</head>
               <p>I Promi≈øed to undertake this Work a long time ago, and 'tis yet longer ≈øince I projected it: 'Tis now at la≈øt come to its perfection; but I am afraid to venture too much by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing of it, my own Experience in ≈øeveral Occa≈øions, and my frequent Conver≈øing with very Rational Men, together with my particular Study, have a thou≈øand times afforded me the occa≈øion to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59386:44"/>con≈øider, Whether it was po≈ø≈øible, that whatever the Vulgar, and the Learned ≈øay of Devils, and whatever they a≈øcribe to them, were true? I would not have ≈øpar'd ≈øo much time as to ≈øearch into this matter, had not I perceiv'd that the Opinions of mo≈øt Men, and perhaps of all the World, are only grounded upon an un≈øure and wavering Foundation. This has moved me impartially to examine ≈øeveral things, which my Calling, and common Conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered to me. This examination forced my Mind to reject many Opinions which I had admitted at fir≈øt, only becau≈øe they were common; though grounded upon in≈øufficient Rea≈øons, as I came by degrees to be ≈øen≈øible of; ≈øo that I find that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent I know much le≈øs than I formerly imagined to do, e≈øpecially as to the ≈øubject in hand. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I do not ≈øay with a de≈øign to Cen≈øure, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy, what others have Written: I only intend to joyn my Thoughts to theirs for a fuller In≈øtruction of ≈øuch Readers as love Truth, and are enquiring after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. I am not afraid to mi≈øtake, if I ≈øay, that whatever belongs to this matter has not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hau≈øted. Tho≈øe that have written upon it before having been ≈øomewhat retarded by Prejudices, that ≈øtick to their Mind, though they had freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves of many others; for I own they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ≈øo far as to de≈øtroy mo≈øt of the works of the Devil; at lea≈øt ≈øo far as 'twas nece≈ø≈øary to free Men from Super≈øtition and frivolous Fears: But, as for me, I would, if it were po≈ø≈øible, altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, and not leave one Stone upon another, that ≈øhould not be demoli≈øhed. And therefore I'll try whether I can bring my Countrymen to my Opinion, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of my Profe≈ø≈øion, de≈øiring them to read this Treati≈øe with as little prejudice as I have written; and not to ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59386:44"/>by other Rea≈øons, but such as proceed from Natural Light, from a clear Interpretation of the Holy Scripture, and from certain Experiments. I have right to require the≈øe Conditions from the Reader, ≈øince they cannot be rejected by any Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Per≈øon, that they are a Law to which I ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ≈øelf, and that the great con≈øequence of the matter requires them.</p>

I am Confident, and I hope, that the Reader will more plainly perceive it hereafter, that no point of the Chri≈øtian Religion is more important than this; and that no certain and ≈øufficient proofs may be had of all the others, than by rejecting the Opinion commonly receiv'd among≈øt the Vulgar, concerning the Craft and Power of the Devil. Can it be imagin'd a ≈ømall Matter to know whether the Devil has a Kingdom upon Earth; and what are the Limits that ≈øeparate his Dominions from that of God Almighty? Or is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> un≈øerviceable to examine, whether ≈øuch a cur≈øed and dete≈øtable Creature can do more wonderful things than God ever did; and con≈øequently, whether the tru≈øt we repo≈øe in God, and the fear we have of the Devil, ought to be equal? Such Thoughts ought never to enter into a Chri≈øtian Heart; yet they creep into it unawares; at lea≈øt I think ≈øo, and can ≈øcarce doubt of it: for the more I ≈øearch into this matter the more it ≈øeems evident to me; that whoever entirely believes all that it u≈øed to be a≈øcrib'd to the Devils and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all that is commonly ≈øaid of them, both by the Learned and the Vulgar, ≈øaving the bottom of the Doctrine publickly receiv'd and taught in our Church; he can have no convincing proof that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>S</hi> is the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> or that there is but one God: And if in this Writing I do not make the Reader very ≈øen≈øible of it, I grant that I have compo≈øed it to no purpo≈øe.</p>

But if I ≈øucceed, it will at the ≈øame time plainly appear, that it was altogether nece≈ø≈øary to publi≈øh this Treati≈øe, becau≈øe the Vulgar are ≈øtill confirm'd in their Errors by Men of Letters, and of great Name; who, being full them≈øelves of tho≈øe prejudices, make u≈øe of their Tongue and Learning to lead others into the ≈øame Labyrinth. To that end they wre≈øt ≈øeveral Expre≈ø≈øions and Hi≈øtories of the Holy Scripture; which being not accurately examined, nor conferr'd with others, give a great probability to the common Opinion concerning the Devil; but if taken in the ordinary Sen≈øe, they prove evidently oppos'd to other clear Expre≈ø≈øions concerning the Fundamental Articles of our Faith: It follows, that ≈øuch a Sen≈øe cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt without overthrowing the grounds of our Salvation; that I can hardly bear, ≈øince a long time the nicety with which Points of ≈ømall con≈øequence, or at lea≈øt of little certainty, u≈øe to be treated of; ≈øince one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not di≈øcu≈øs them without getting into a ≈øu≈øpicion of entertaining Erroneous Opinions; whil≈øt, in the mean time, we are not yet agreed upon Matters of the utmo≈øt con≈øequence; or if we are agreed upon them, it 'tis without any foundation: And therefore, ≈øince none was ever found fault with for defending an Article of Faith, or giving out a new Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; ≈øo I per≈øuade my ≈øelf, that I do well by publi≈øhing the Illu≈øtrations upon a matter, on which the whole Edifice of our Salvation is grounded; in order that whoever will carefully and impartially examine it, may become Wi≈øer and Learneder.</p>

The de≈øign is to examine to the bottom what the Devil can do, and what he really doth; that is, How far his Knowledge extends; either in Natural or Supernatural Things. Either as to the Pre≈øence,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59386:45"/>as it is conceal'd from Men; or as to the Future, as it is contingent, or po≈ø≈øible, and not nece≈ø≈øary. Moreover, what Direction or Power he has to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in Nature, what Communication he has with Men, with the Human Soul, and with all ≈øorts of Bodies? That he ≈øhould tran≈ømute him≈øelf into them, or put on their various Forms: That he ≈øhould act upon the Soul, or upon the Body: That he ≈øhould direct Thoughts, Words, Actions, and Ge≈øtures: What is his Power over the Bea≈øts and Fruits of the Earth; Over the Air and Winds: What his help may contribute to the Knowledge of Man and his Actions. Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt <hi>Auguries,</hi> or Sooth≈øaying, Witchcraft, the Art of Conjuring up Gho≈øts, and of Divining Dreams. All which things are methodically (and in the ≈øame order that is mentioned here) treated of in this Book.</p>

But becau≈øe the perfect Knowledge of them depends upon another, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spirit, wherein it con≈øi≈øts, and how it's di≈øtingui≈øhed from that of the Body: (for Devils are undeniably Spirits, and Man is compo≈øed of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a Spirit) ≈øo it will be nece≈ø≈øary in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe to proceed farther, and to examine fir≈øt the Nature of Spirits, Good and Bad, and then that of Man. Be≈øides, God him≈øelf being a Spirit, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and independent, we ought not to pay our ≈øelves with the conformity of the Name; but by rea≈øon of the manife≈øt difference betwixt the Creator and the Creature, we are obliged more particularly to examine, how much the increated Spirit differs from tho≈øe that are created; and among≈øt the≈øe la≈øt, how much tho≈øe that are immaterial, and tho≈øe that are united with a Body, differ from each other.</p>

However, ≈øuch a difficult piece of work cannot be undertaken, without knowing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions and Practices upon this Subject; and without ≈øpecial Con≈øiderations upon them: Now, whoever ≈øhall reflect upon what is ≈øaid and practic'd, as to this matter, through all the World, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon the conver≈øe, which Men may have with the Spirits, and the Operations that may attend them, he will undoubtedly de≈øire to be well informed of all the≈øe things, that he may di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt the Truth and Fal≈øhood of tho≈øe Opinions, and what is lawful and unlawful in tho≈øe Practices. For the≈øe Rea≈øons I de≈øcribe all the Sentiments that have been receiv'd among≈øt Men, in all Ages and Places what≈øoever, concerning God and the Spirits; what means Men have made u≈øe of to conjure them up and down; and what they may be able to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the help of tho≈øe Spirits: whence proceeds a ≈øufficient matter for a more particular examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what ≈øound Rea≈øon, and the Holy Scripture teach us, as to this Point, and what experience te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. To treat of the≈øe things methodically, I have divided this Treati≈øe into four Books. In the fir≈øt I propo≈øe the Opinions and Cu≈øtoms of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in all Ages, Countries, and Religions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Deity, and the good and bad Spirits. I ≈øay the Opinions and Cu≈øtoms; for in the matter we undertake to treat of, we mu≈øt take a ≈øpecial notice of the≈øe two things; the Knowledge, and the Action; Since no Fruit can be perceived from the Knowledge, but by putting it into Practice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, we fee every where that the Behaviour of Men, either in the Words or Actions, has a relation to the Doctrines they have been taught. For this Rea≈øon I have again divided in two parts, the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of what is contained in the fir≈øt Book. In
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59386:46"/>the fir≈øt part I enquire what Knowledge may be had or Spirits, of their Power and Operations, according to Rea≈øon and the Holy Scripture; which Enquiry is the matter of the Second Book. In the other part, which is the ≈øubject of the Third Book, I examine tho≈øe Sciences that are ≈øaid to be grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; as Witchcraft, Divination, Conjuring, and the like. Moreover, as Men u≈øe to have recour≈øe to experience, not only in things which are not di≈øcover'd by Rea≈øon, and of which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ≈øilent; but al≈øo e≈øpecially in this Ca≈øe, in which Rea≈øon, and the Holy Writ, are made to ≈øpeak, according to the certainty which we ≈øuppo≈øe to have acquired by Experience: This Con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has furni≈øhed me with the matter of the Fourth Book, in which I examine all that Men te≈øtifie ever to have experienced in them≈øelves, or profe≈øs to have done.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. But the great difference and Divi≈øions, that were among≈øt the <hi>Heathens</hi> them≈øelves upon this Account, leave us extreamly in the Dark, as to the Opinions that are to be a≈øcribed to them. However, we may agree upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> to take that ≈øtupendous number of differencies for an Uniformity; ≈øo that it may he affirmed, that in all Ages, the <hi>Pagans</hi> have Unanimou≈øly believed, that there is but one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God, the Fir≈øt Univer≈øal cau≈øe of all things; ≈øince the Fir≈øt Doctors of their mo≈øt famous Schools, and the heads of their principal Sects, have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taught this Doctrine to their Di≈øciples. The Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that Old Father of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Religion, may be ≈øeen in <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who writing again≈øt the Heathens, did doubtle≈øs not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ≈øpare them; however he ≈øays, that <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> owned one God, an immaterial Spirit diffu≈øed and extended through all Nature, who gives Life
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59386:48"/>and Sen≈øe to all beings. <hi>Plato,</hi> who has de≈øerved the name of Wi≈øe, by all the ≈øucceeding Ages, agrees with him, as to this point, as appears by his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in his four Books of the Laws. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>God in whom, according to the Ancient Te≈øtimonies, is the beginning, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the end of all things, penetrates every where, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> his great Di≈øciple, who for Two Thou≈øand Years, has been e≈øteemed the Prince of Philo≈øophers, plainly ≈øayes in his Fir≈øt Book of <hi>Metaphy≈øicks, Chap.</hi> the 7th. that <hi>God is Eternal and perfectly good, ≈øo that the Eternal and Infinite Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in him.</hi> From this capital point they infer this other Belief, that the good and evil, which befal Men, proceed from the Fir≈øt and Univer≈øal Deity, as <hi>Plato</hi> more largely explains in the forementioned place. <hi>Equity,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>Eternally attends him, which is the Avenger of tho≈øe that for≈øake the Law of God, but happy is he, who ≈øticks to it, and follows it con≈øtantly.</hi>

But how advantageou≈øly ≈øoever they may ≈øpeak of the ≈øupream Deity, it neverthele≈øs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they do not a≈øcribe to him Independency, nor the immediate direction of all things; ≈øince they divided the Government of the World betwixt ≈øeveral Gods, to each of whom they a≈ø≈øigned his particular ≈øhare. 'Tis very probable that the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> and <hi>Per≈øians,</hi> ob≈øerving how Human affairs were often here below obnoxious to con≈øiderable changes, which proceeded from Heaven, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion from thence, to contrive two ≈øupream Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, proceeding from that Fir≈øt being; one of whom they called <hi>Oromasdes,</hi> and gave him the direction of Heaven; to the other, named <hi>Arimanius,</hi> they a≈øcribed that of the Earth. The <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards gave them the Greek names, <hi>viz.</hi> to the former that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and to the latter, that of <hi>Pluto,</hi> whom they at Fir≈øt look't upon as the God of the Earth.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59386:48"/>And becau≈øe all the wi≈øe held for a certain Truth, that the Heavens ≈øurpa≈øs the Earth in perfection, they placed the ≈øupream Deity in Heaven, and the other Gods under it, each according to his Dignity: And as they conceived that the Soveraign God could never cea≈øe from being good, ≈øo <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who had the Empire of the Heavens, was in great credit among≈øt them; but <hi>Pluto,</hi> the God of Hell, obtain'd but an ill name.</p>

In the latter, they enquired after the Fir≈øt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cau≈øes of all things, of their Motion and Changes, without any reference to Religion. Thus came upon the Stage <hi>Plato,</hi> with his Idea's, and <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> with his Intelligencies, <hi>Plato</hi> called <hi>Idea</hi>'s the principles that flow from the Divine Nature, that ≈øub≈øi≈øts with him, and by which all things ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt; each of them being as an Engraven Image of him, from whom they all proceed; ≈øo that they all partake of the Nature of their Original, and are ≈øuch as the principal, from whence they flow. When I confer the ≈øentiment of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> contained in the words of <hi>Socrates,</hi> related in the <hi>Parmenis,</hi> with what <hi>Plutarch</hi> ≈øayes in his Fir≈øt Book, Chap. the 10th, <hi>of the Opinions of Philo≈øophers;</hi> and <hi>Laertius</hi> in the Life of the ≈øame <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as al≈øo <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the Fir≈øt Book of the <hi>Tu≈øculan Que≈øtions.</hi> Fifty Eight, wherein he explains the meaning of that Philo≈øopher, it ≈øeems to me, that nothing can be better nor more plainly expre≈ø≈øed, concerning this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject.

As to the Fir≈øt, we find in the Authors, and in ≈øeveral others, that every one was eager to obtain the favour of the Gods, whether great or little, and that they earne≈øtly ≈øought to plea≈øe the good Spirits, and to turn off the evil. To this end they built Temples, e≈øtabli≈øh'd Forms of Prayer, con≈øecrated Prie≈øts, offer'd Sacrifices, in≈øtituted Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtivals and Games of all ≈øorts. Be≈øides that, they u≈øed ≈øeveral means to di≈øcover the de≈øigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Gods, together with the happine≈øs and misfortune of Men; to which they ≈øuppo≈øed to attain, either by the Knowledge they might receive from the help of the Demons, the communication of the <hi>Penates,</hi> of the <hi>Remures,</hi> by the means of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

There, were two, ≈øorts of Divinations Anciently in u≈øe among≈øt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> the one was rightly called <hi>Natural,</hi> but the other <hi>Artificial,</hi> they held for a <hi>Natural Divination,</hi> what ever a particular, free, and voluntary Action of the Mind of Man, without the help of Rea≈øon, or any Conjecture, or Progno≈øtick, portended as future, as it often happens in a Dream, and even without Sleeping in the Fits of a raving Fever, thence the Godde≈ø≈øes called <hi>Furies,</hi> had their Name and 'twas believ'd, that ≈øome Prie≈øts, and even the <hi>Sybil, Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threa</hi> had begun to utter their Oracles in ≈øuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxy≈øins. <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> gave their An≈øwers in ≈øuch a way, and by ≈øuch ≈øort of People of which their Prie≈øts them≈øelves boa≈øted.

They ca≈øt their Lots in a very ≈øimple way, for they cut the branch of a Fruit-tree in ≈øeveral little Lots, on each of which they make a particular mark, and then Confu≈øedly throw them on a piece of white Cloth. There the Prie≈øt, if matters of State are treated of, or the Father of the Family, when it concerns him, or his hou≈øe looking to he Heavens, lifts up thrice each little Lot, and gives the explication of the marks printed on them; if they di≈ø≈øwade, no farther con≈øultation is made that day; but if they allow to proceed, they go to the Diviners for an An≈øwer. There is yet another particular way of predicting among≈øt that people, by the means of white Hor≈øes, that were never back'd, and are kept together in a Fore≈øt at the Publick Co≈øt. They hunt them, and the Prie≈øt, King or Governor ≈øitting on a con≈øecrated Chariot, ob≈øerves their Neighing and Foam.

'Tis very probable, that when tho≈øe Men were got at Court and in great e≈øteem among≈øt the Vulgar, their Art was not ≈øufficient to keep up their Reputation; then they begun to u≈øe Craft and Cheats, and even ≈øome of them, abu≈øed that Art ≈øo far, as to joyn Malice to Deception, and not to ≈øpare either the Goods, or the Blood or ≈øeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; ≈øo that as on the one ≈øide, the Pagans extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured that ≈øort of People, becau≈øe of their Wit and parts; ≈øo they de≈øpi≈øed them upon another Account, and had a great hatred for them. Thence proceeded that ≈øome have Anciently been famous in the Magick Art, as well for the good, as the bad u≈øe they made of it, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tyanis,</hi> who≈øe Life has been written by <hi>Philo≈øtrates,</hi> and <hi>Elymas,</hi> who re≈øi≈øted St. <hi>Paul, Acts,</hi> 13. <hi>Ver≈øe</hi> 8. And the Wi≈øemen of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> who were called to expound the Dreams of their Kings. <hi>Gen. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Ver≈øe</hi> 8. And <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ver≈øe</hi> 4. Even <hi>Mo≈øes, Daniel,</hi> the Wi≈øemen of the Ea≈øt, who ≈øought the King of the <hi>Jews</hi> newly born; all tho≈øe Men were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Magick, th√¥ Authors ≈øpeak variou≈øly of them, either with or again≈øt them, there is ≈øo much difference betwixt the ≈øame Sciences and the ≈øame Actions, by the good or bad u≈øe that is made of them. Neverthele≈øs, it was properly that Art, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59386:60"/>which we now give the name of Magick. <hi>Agrippa</hi> of <hi>Nettinheim,</hi> di≈øtingui≈øhes it in Two ≈øorts, one of which may be called <hi>Natural Magick</hi> and the other <hi>Artificial;</hi> becau≈øe the fir≈øt having Natural cau≈øes, produces Natural Effects, but the Second being an invention of Art, Nature has no ≈øhare in it's Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I mean that as it is nece≈ø≈øary in all Arts and Handicrafts, that Nature ≈øhould ≈øupply the matter and power of Action, th√¥ the Workman imploys them this or that way, only by the rules of his Art. It goes even ≈øo with the Arti≈øts of whom I ≈øpeak, and not as which a Husbandman, who can only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Ground, ca≈øt his Seed upon, or plant a Tree upon it, but mu≈øt expect the Harve≈øt and Fruit from Nature it ≈øelf, holpen with his Art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <q>They believe, ≈øays <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magick</hi> is but the highe≈øt Degree of power, in Natural Sciences; for which Rea≈øon they call it the <hi>extream and la≈øt perfection of the knowledge of Nature;</hi> ≈øaying, that it is the active part of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wi≈ødom, which, by the help of Natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er u≈øed in proper time, operates wonderful effects, and rai≈øes Admiration. The <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> made a ≈øpecial u≈øe of that Magick, that is, as much as it was able to produce effects, by the power of Herbs, Stones, and other things of the ≈øame kind. Moreover, ≈øays again <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for that Rea≈øon, Natural Magick is that, which penetrates the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all Natural things, and which with a ≈øubtle di≈øcerning, having exactly ≈øearched into their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durations, and Sympathies, di≈øcovers ≈øo far their ≈øecret powers, that by them it produces wonders, which amaze Humane under≈øtanding; not ≈øo much by Art, as Nature, to which, as to its Soveraign Art ≈øubmits it ≈øelf, and only lends her the helping Hand.</q> Thus we can by Natural ways produce ripe Fruits before their Sea≈øon, and even infects,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59386:60"/>only by ≈øupplying the want of time, by Natural means unknown to other Men; as it is done, th√¥ in a le≈øs Degree of perfection, by Gardners, each of whom, ≈øtrives to be the fir≈øt in getting early Fruits, helping Nature by Art, and ≈øtill however by the means of Nature her ≈øelf. The difference only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in this, that a <hi>Magus,</hi> who wholly gives up him≈øelf to his ≈øtudy, penetrates much farther into the knowledge of the power of Nature, than the Vulgar, and even tho≈øe learned, who care not to take that trouble upon them. But as all the≈øe things are done without the particular a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of God and the Spirits, they concern not the pre≈øent que≈øtion; however we mention them, that we may learn to di≈øtingui≈øh them from the ≈øubject in Hand, and all it's dependencies, of which we intend to give a clear and undeniable notion.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. We have hitherto ≈øeen the Magick of the Pagans, included within the bounds of Nature. Now I de≈øire the Reader to remember what I have ≈øaid in my Commentary upon <hi>Daniel, Sect.</hi> 26. <hi>viz.</hi> That to the Magick antiently in u≈øe <hi>Mathematicks, Phy≈øick,</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> were ordinarily conjoyned; ≈øome giving up them≈øelves to one of tho≈øe Sciences, and others to another, whence proceeded a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Names, betwixt the Students of Magick; ≈øome of whom were called <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and others <hi>Phy≈øicians,</hi> or by a more odious name, <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners.</hi> The former applyed them≈øelve chiefly to perform wonderful things; and the others to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate Wickedne≈øs. Among≈øt their Wonders may be counted the Wooden Dove of <hi>Architas,</hi> that fly'd, and the Statues of <hi>Mercury</hi> that ≈øpake; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of <hi>Poi≈øoners</hi> was to annoy Men, their Goods and their Bea≈øts, by many things commonly unknown. And having learned the Virtues and Properties of them by their Study, they put them, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59386:61"/>u≈øe in ≈øuch a concealed and imperceptible way, that one could ≈øcatce belieye what he ≈øaw effected; and this is, what they really operated. But as to what they boa≈øted of be≈øides, or perhaps, imagin'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves capable of; it was, that by the virtues of Simples, and ≈øome other Drugs mixed together, they could transform Men into Bea≈øts, Bea≈øts into Men, Bea≈øts and Men into other Bea≈øts and Men, conjure up Gho≈øts, or rai≈øe the Dead out of their Graves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Now we mu≈øt ≈øpeak of Magick meerly <hi>Artificial,</hi> which may rightly be ≈øo called, becau≈øe Nature has no ≈øhare in it; but that is a work of Art alone, which however pre≈øuppo≈øes Nature; one may al≈øo very fitly give the names of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Conjuration, and Inchanting in general, to all the various practi≈øes that are made of it; for we call Witchcraft whatever is operated by the power of the Devil, with the communication of Men, which is never done, without u≈øing ≈øome ≈øort of Conjuration , and Inchanting. That Art which required of its Profe≈ø≈øors a particular way of living, always con≈øi≈øted in the u≈øe of ≈øome certain Signs and Words, that they utter'd or wrote, and in extraordinary Ge≈øtures, in con≈øideration of which, the Demons were ready at all times to di≈øcover to them hidden things; and to operate in their behalf, ≈øupernatural Wonders. This was therefore the opinion of the Heathens, that be≈øides natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, they believed them≈øelves capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the mo≈øt wonderful effects by the power of Demons, whom they knew how to make comply, by their Conjurations, to whatever they de≈øired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. We mu≈øt carefully ob≈øerve this, becau≈øe, <hi>natural Magick</hi> is not commonly accurately di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed from the <hi>Artificial,</hi> either by the Antients or by the Moderns; and that which belongs to one,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59386:61"/>is frequently attributed to the other: even tho≈øe that meddle with it, having committed as many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtakes as the others. <q>For ≈øome of them, ≈øays <hi>Agrippa,</hi> are come to that heighth of Folly, as to believe, that by the different Concour≈øe and A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of the Stars, with the interpo≈øition of time and proportions duely ob≈øerved, they may, in a certain in≈øtant, acquire a ≈øen≈øible Idaea of Cele≈øtial things, and a Spirit of Life and Under≈øtanding; which being Interrogated by them, will give them An≈øwers, and di≈øcover 'em hidden things.</q> On the other ≈øide, they a≈øcribe to Nature what is above her power, which I cannot better expre≈øs, than by the very words of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who proceeds thus. <q>I de≈øire you to take notice, that tho≈øe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> not only rake up into natural things, but even in a manner remove Nature out of her place; which they endeavour to do by Motions, by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by Ge≈øtures, by Sounds, by Voices, by Congregations, by Lights, by the Inclinations of the Mind, and by Words. Thus it was that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>P≈øilli</hi> and <hi>Mar≈øi</hi> conjured Serpents, and put them to flight; thus <hi>Orpheus</hi> by his ≈øinging allay'd the Tempe≈øts, for the ≈øake of the <hi>Argonauts;</hi> Thus, as <hi>Homer</hi> relates, by ≈øome certain words, the blood of <hi>

But it may be ≈øeen in <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> what account they them≈øelves make of the Gods of Thunder, and of the Spirits in the Air. For ≈øays he, they not only pretend to give ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors to their Gods in their quarrels they have with their Enemies, endeavouring to imitate the Thunder with the beating of Hammers, but are not afraid even of Fighting again≈øt them with Arrows and other Arms, they, ≈øhoot in the Air.

The <hi>I≈ølanders</hi> have more relation to the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Fuilanders,</hi> the greate≈øt knowledge we have of them, comes to us from the writings of <hi>Blefkenius,</hi> they al≈øo believe Dome≈øtick Spirits, who wake them in the Night, to go a Fi≈øhing, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded, that if one ≈øhould go thither without the Adverti≈øement of the≈øe Spirits, he could not make a happy Fi≈øhing. The ≈øame <hi>Ditmarus Blefkenius,</hi> ≈øailing from that Countrey to <hi>Portugal</hi> in 1633, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from one <hi>Jonas</hi> a Handkerchief, with three Knots, to be loo≈øed at Sea, in ca≈øe he wanted Wind.

We ≈øhall hear them unanimou≈øly grant, that to ≈øpeak properly, there is but one <hi>Divine Being,</hi> who≈øe virtue extends every where. However, when they came to con≈øider the various objects of the Divine Admini≈øtration, and his different effects. they divided the Government of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Principal, and many Inferior Gods, as the Ancient Heathens, of whom we have ≈øpoken.</p>

Thus the <hi>Japanders</hi> have intru≈øted <hi>Chaca</hi> and <hi>Amida</hi> with the ≈øupream admini≈øtration of all things, and <hi>Tanconida, Benjamonda, Homocanda Zoiola, Pipi</hi> and <hi>Ji≈øus,</hi> with the particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heavens, whither the la≈øt leads the Souls of the decea≈øed. The principle Sect among≈øt the <hi>Chine≈øe,</hi> is that which follows the Sentiments of <hi>Conr futius,</hi> who is e≈øteemed a great Saint among≈øt them. That <hi>Sect,</hi> ≈øays <hi>Carobius,</hi> in the words of <hi>Trigaltius,</hi> acknowledges and adores <hi>one only God,</hi> believing that he governs and keeps all things here below. They
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59386:69"/>al≈øo venerate the Spirits, but much le≈øs than that Deity; neither do they a≈øcribe to them ≈øo great a Power. All the≈øe People imagine a graduation from the Great Gods to the Inferior Gods, and from them to the Spirits; for the≈øe pretend that the Soveraign God, has ≈øet over the Heavens <hi>Laocon,</hi> that is, <hi>the Mini≈øter of the Great God,</hi> and upon the Inferior World <hi>Can≈øai,</hi> who has under him three Spirits, <hi>Tanduam, Teiquam,</hi> and <hi>T≈øuiquam:</hi> the fir≈øt of whom has the direction of the Air; the ≈øecond of the Earth, and the third of the Sea. Among≈øt the inferior Gods, who are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they reckon the Inventors of Arts, e≈øpecially <hi>Sichia, Quanina,</hi> and <hi>Neoma, a God and two God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈ø≈øes.</hi> Among≈øt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> tho≈øe of <hi>Sarmacande,</hi> who border on the Empire of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> are <hi>Mahometans.</hi> But among≈øt the others, particularly tho≈øe of <hi>Niuche,</hi> on whom the Empire of <hi>Chinais</hi> now depending. The Deity is likewi≈øe divided into two; the one is the God of Heaven, and the other of the Earth; but they make the condition of the fir≈øt, ≈øo high and ≈øublime, that it may be ea≈øily perceived, they acknowledge but one God indeed.</p>

Tho≈øe that inhabit the North of the Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> and reach to the Dominions of the Great Mogul, tho' they be much divided in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet agree in this point, that there is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Deity, called either <hi>Vi≈øtenau</hi> or <hi>E≈øuara,</hi> who, however Governs the world only by the Mini≈øtry of inferior Gods, of whom <hi>Brama,</hi> who is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Director of all things, is the Chief. Some ≈øay, that all the≈øe three depend upon <hi>T≈øechti,</hi> as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the only Sovereign God. But after all, the difference is not ≈øo much in the thing as in the name. They all believe that <hi>Brama</hi> gives to <hi>Indre</hi> or <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endre</hi> a Supream Authority, over 8 principal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the Superior World, who they place higher than the Earth, and neverthele≈øs under <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malocon,</hi> which is the abode of <hi>Brama.</hi> Of the≈øe eight, ≈øeven receive the Souls of the dying, who have led a good Life, and the eighth receives that of the Damned.

On the one ≈øide, we find that Nations, that extreamly differ in the Opinions they have concerning the Gods and the Spirits; yet on the other ≈øide, they wonderfully agree upon the ≈øame ≈øubject. They differ in the Names they give them, which is not ≈øtrange, the Tongues being ≈øo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and all the Nations not a≈øcribing the ≈øame properties to Spiritual Beings. Thence proceeds a ≈øecond difference, that they make not their number equal, nor di≈øtingui≈øh them in the ≈øame manner, as to their Dignity and Admini≈øtration, or as to their Operations, as it has particularly been ≈øhewn in the 2 <hi>Chap.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. WE have hitherto only con≈øidered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani≈øm,</hi> which has no other light but that of Nature; now we ≈øhall enquire, what tho≈øe that are illuminated with the light of the Holy Scripture, believe or practi≈øe upon that account, In the mean while, it mu≈øt be ob≈øerved, that they are not all of one ≈øen≈øe, being divided into <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtians;</hi> which difference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the inequality of the light they have received, or made u≈øe of; I ≈øhall begin with tho≈øe that are at greate≈øt di≈øtance from Chri≈øtianity, and con≈øequently the neare≈øt to <hi>Pagani≈øm.</hi> It ≈øeems that the followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ≈øhould have that place; ≈øo much the more, becau≈øe we have favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices on behalf of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as having Anciently been the People of God. But notwith≈øtanding what they have been, they are now ≈øo much degenerated, that the belief of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> may be ≈øaid to have more conformity with ours, then theirs hath, both dete≈øt Idolatry, and acknowledge one God, and take his word for the rule of their Faith. The <hi>Jews</hi> receive only the Old Te≈øtament, but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> admit al≈øo of the New, adding the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> to tho≈øe of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> in order to correct and perfect them both. The <hi>Jews</hi> do almo≈øt the ≈øame as to the Law of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> by the Addition of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which contains the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Ancient. But if the Opinions of both
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59386:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>parties were deeply ≈øearched into, perhaps it would be found that tho≈øe of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> favour more the infalibility of the Law and Go≈øpel, than tho≈øe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that of the Law alone. Add to this, that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is acknowledged by the <hi>Mahometans</hi> for a great Prophet, and honoured in that quality, whereas he is horribly bla≈øphemed by the <hi>Jews.</hi> For the≈øe rea≈øons I ≈øay, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are halfe nearer to us, than the modern <hi>Jews.</hi> But what need we any farther proof, ≈øince as to this matter, it is plain that the <hi>Jews</hi> are le≈øs from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani≈øm</hi> than the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as ≈øhall appear by the proof I ≈øhall produce.</p>

As long as we have had to do with <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> only, we needed but to make an inquiry after their Opinions concerning their Gods, the Spirits, and the Souls. But here the Que≈øtion is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the plurality of Gods, for th√¥ formerly the <hi>Jews</hi> have been extraordinarily inclined to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they have now ≈øuch a great aver≈øion for <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thei≈øm,</hi> ever ≈øince 2300 years, that they are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, that they will acknowledge but one Per≈øon in the Divine Unity. They believe, by the light of <hi>the Holy Writ,</hi> that this <hi>only God</hi> is Almighty, and ≈øufficient to him≈øelf, and to all things, which he has created of nothing and governs and maintains alone. Among≈øt his Creatures they reckon Angels and Men, and think that the la≈øt have a Soul more excellent, than that of Bruits, tho' far inferior to the Angelical Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Such has been in all times the belief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ≈øo farr is more agreeable to the <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faith, then that of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as we ≈øhall ≈øay hereafter.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> of that time were Orthodox, ≈øave only tho≈øe who ≈øuffer'd them≈øelves to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Idolatry, and undoubtedly they had no other Opinion of the Angels, Demons, and Souls of Men, but what the <hi>Holy Writings</hi> ≈øtill teach us; ≈øo that if we ≈øtill look upon them as different from us, it is becau≈øe we con≈øider tho≈øe of latter times, when their State was in its fall, and <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> in its growth. But tho' they be now divided into two Sects, that of the <hi>Carraijim,</hi> who only follow the <hi>Holy Writ;</hi> and that of the <hi>Rabbanim,</hi> who adhere to the Traditions of their Doctors; there is yet but the latter, which de≈øerves to come into con≈øideration, the number of the former being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together incon≈øiderable, they being a remainder of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> which are hardly known in <hi>Europe,</hi> whereas, the other may be called the po≈øterity of the <hi>Phari≈øees.</hi>

If we come more particularly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Opinions as to the Spirits, whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Human Souls, we ≈øhall not find the Ancient and Modern Writers agree well together. <hi>Philo,</hi> who is among≈øt the former, believes, <hi>That the Air is full of Spirits, the mo≈øt perfect of whom never a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Bodies, but go to and fro, a≈øcend and de≈øcend from Heaven upon Earth, for the ≈øervice of the Great God.

But be≈øides tho≈øe ≈øingularities, we may take notice that all their Witchcraft is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two grounds, the influences of the Stars, and thy apparitions of Spirits, the rea≈øon of the former ground is, that th√¥ they e≈øteem not the Cele≈øtial lights to be Gods; yet they a≈øcribe to them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular virtue, working upon, and influencing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Actions, as well external as internal ≈øen≈øes.

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. WE mu≈øt not wonder that great, part of the Doctrines above mentioned, have not yet been bani≈øhed by the light of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For what Man naturally conceives, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways darkne≈øs, neither is the illumination which the <hi>Holy writ</hi> affords to the under≈øtanding, always effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; ≈øo that a Chri≈øtian, often better knows what he ought to know, then he does what he ought to do. This plainly appears, in that Man is readier to ≈øearch after the Truth by his rea≈øon, than to put it in practice by his Virtue. The cau≈øe of it is, that our natural curio≈øity that has contributed to the fall of our fir≈øt Parents, has been ≈øince increa≈øed and ≈øtrengthned by the effect of the fall it ≈øelf; and that it drives us on ≈øo much the more to de≈øire to know much, as our under≈øtanding is become le≈øs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of true conceptions. But the corruption of Man allows him not to make ≈øuch Progre≈ø≈øe. And therefore we mu≈øt imagine, that whatever is practiced among≈øt ≈øuch or ≈øuch People, e≈øpecially as to Religion, always and only proceeds from their belief and Doctrine. This will quickly be known to us, if we take the trouble of con≈øidering Chri≈øtianity, ≈øuch as it formerly was, and ≈øtill is at this pre≈øent.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. I ≈øhall name ancient Chri≈øtianity the ≈øix fir≈øt Centuries before the Pope and <hi>Mahomet</hi> aro≈øe: However, I ≈øhall not con≈øider it as it was e≈øtabli≈øh'd by our Lord and his Apo≈øtles, which will be done more conveniently hereafter, but with relation to the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of times: In the mean while a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful di≈øtinction mu≈øt be made between the Opinions of the Church, or of the Chief Doctors of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the Errors of tho≈øe ≈øhe has condemn'd. We mu≈øt afterwards take notice of what certainty may be had both of the Practices and particular Sen≈øe of tho≈øe that have been branded for Hereticks. For we pretend not to impute to Chri≈øtians what has been rejected by the generality of them, nor to charge the Hereticks with whatever is ≈øaid of their Errours. Now, one may, methinks, take for Opinions generally received in the Church, tho≈øe that have been taught by their Chief Doctors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contradicted by the others, as far as it appears by any Writing, though they mu≈øt not for that be taken for Articles of Faith. And likewi≈øe, though the Hereticks ≈øhould have been charged, as to the Doctrine, with ≈øome Opinions they owned not, yet 'tis not conceiveable that they ≈øhould have been fal≈øly accu≈øed of Acts of Magick, the po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of which they did not ≈øo much as believe. After that Ob≈øervation let's ≈øee what the mo≈øt famous Chri≈øtians of the Primitive times have believed, as to Spirits and their Operations, and at the ≈øame time what they relate of other Sects and People.</p>

I ≈øhall pa≈øs by the fir≈øt Century, in which the Apo≈øtles lived, becau≈øe in my ≈øecond Book I take their Writings for the Rule of Faith, and for the Fountain whence Truth mu≈øt be drawn. But we mu≈øt examine tho≈øe that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59386:114"/>them from Age to Age, and ≈øee what was their Opinion upon tho≈øe two Points, without pre≈øuming it was grounded upon Rule, or Eccle≈øia≈øtical A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which appears not. And though tho≈øe two Points are of the highe≈øt con≈øequence, yet every one had ≈øtill liberty to expre≈øs his particular Opinions. However, for other Opinions of le≈øs con≈øequence, and I dur≈øt almo≈øt ≈øay of nothing, Men have been dealt with as Hereticks, and the whole Chri≈øtian World mu≈øt be call'd together to come to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. And therefore I ≈øhall only make u≈øe here of ≈øuch Explications of the chief Doctors, as I have read my ≈øelf, which I ≈øhall endeavour to tran≈ølate faithfully, and word for word, as much as po≈ø≈øible.</p>

We ≈øhall fir≈øt hear in the ≈øecond Age, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtin,</hi> concerning the Nature of Angels. <hi>Tatian</hi> indeed a≈øcribes not a gro≈øs material Being to the Angels, and yet he ≈øeems to attribute to them ≈øome Corporeal Being. Here are his own Words that ≈øeem very ≈øtrange. <hi>All Demons are ≈øo as that indeed they have nothing Carnal, but their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition is Spiritual, and as a Fire and Light. The Nature of their Bodies can however be penetrated by none but ≈øuch as are endued with the Spirit of God.</hi> What he adds afterwards is more Con≈øonant to Rea≈øon, <hi>That the Demons are not the Souls of Men.</hi> He believes not however <hi>that Souls are ≈øimple Natures, but that they are compo≈øed of parts <gap reason="foreign">

                  </hi> becau≈øe he believes they cannot be conceived as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, without having a Body, and that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part cannot ri≈øe without the Soul. Several Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of that time ≈øpeak very near the Words, tho' they explain not them≈øelves ≈øo openly, ≈øo that they mu≈øt not be look'd upon as very far from that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as will more plainly appear, when we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fall of the Angels.</p>

This he teaches in his 42th <hi>Que≈øtion,</hi> having ≈øaid before in the 40th, <hi>That a Wicked Spirit that has been once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59386:115"/>cannot torment him any more whom he had before po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd.</hi> In the afore≈øaid 42th Que≈øtion, he ≈øays, That when a po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd ≈øeems to break his Bands and Fetters, it is the Demon that does it who has that ≈øtrength him≈øelf, but cannot communicate it to the Body of any Man. This is very particular, and it will be fit to call it to mind again in another place, wherefore I de≈øire the Reader to ob≈øerve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. <hi>Origen,</hi> who lived in the third Age, had ≈øtrange Notions concerning the Angels; ≈øometimes he gives them a Nature but equal to that of Men: For Writing of the Light, which St. <hi>John</hi> in his fir≈øt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59386:115"/>Chapter, ≈øays to be our Saviour, he ≈øeems to believe that it was equally communicated to Man and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as may be ≈øeen more at large in his third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume on St. <hi>John.</hi> But in another place he makes ≈øo great a di≈øtinction betwixt Angels and Men, that going from the fir≈øt of Creatures endued with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, to the la≈øt, he puts the Angels as betwixt God and Men: For he teaches, on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. that the fir≈øt Creatures are tho≈øe which the Holy Writ names <hi>Gods;</hi> The ≈øecond, tho≈øe that we call'd <hi>Thrones;</hi> and the third, tho≈øe that bear the name of <hi>Principalities.</hi> Afterwards he calls in Que≈øtion, Whether Man is the la≈øt of rational Creatures, or whether ≈øuch Creatures as dwell upon Earth, among≈øt which he ranks all the Demons, or at lea≈øt part of them, are inferiour to Men? that's his Opinion in his fir≈øt <hi>Vol.</hi> St. <hi>John.</hi>

He again intimates el≈øewhere, that as Men who have had the fear of God in this life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Angels after their Death, as 'tis read in St. <hi>Matth,</hi> 22.30. though there it is not properly, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Angels,</hi> but <hi>they ≈øhall be like Angels:</hi> So that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Angels might formerly have been Men: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he imagines that Angels and Men may di≈øpute which are more perfect, e≈øtabli≈øting betwixt the Nature of tho≈øe two Subjects, the ≈øame difference which our Saviour puts between the fir≈øt and the la≈øt, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.30. and ch. 20.16. he a≈øcribes to Angels, not only the <hi>Subregency</hi> of the World, in his tenth Homil. upon <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and con≈øtitutes, as well as other Doctors, Guardian Angels upon that Principle; but he per≈øuades him≈øelf that their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Devotions may increa≈øe, as tho≈øe of Men, proportionably to tho≈øe of the Per≈øons they keep. Afterwards he de≈øtines ≈øome to watch over little Children, and others over the Adult, grounding his Opinion upon St. <hi>Matt. ch.</hi> 18.10. where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Job</hi> 25.5. he repeates the ≈øame at the end of his 2d <hi>Volume upon St. John,</hi> denying however that their Influences ≈øhould hurt Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding what is read of Lunaticks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.14, 15.

He ≈øtrains the Words of God to <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 40, v. 15.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59386:116"/>for he takes them as they are now read in the Greek Bibles, as though there was <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that Dragon,</hi> (whereas the Hebrew Text has <hi>Behemoth,</hi> that ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a great Bea≈øt) Tran≈ølating the Ver≈øe thus, <hi>This is the beginning of what God formed, which he mad: for a matter of laughter to his Angels.</hi>

               <p>Sect. 12. <hi>Tertullian</hi> explains him≈øelf more plainly as to the knowledge he a≈øcribes to the Devils, when he in his fifth Book again≈øt <hi>Marcion</hi> ≈øpeeks thus. <hi>Servants cannot know the Re≈øolutions of their Ma≈øters, and therefore the Rebellious Angels, and the Devil their leader, can much le≈øs know the de≈øigns of God, whence I would willingly take occa≈øion to a≈ø≈øert, that the greater their Crime has been the more remote they are from the knowledge of their Creator.</hi> So far only he goes, as to the Secrets of God. But as to tho≈øe of Men, we hear the Doctors of that Age giving to the Demons a power over Bodies and Souls. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhes both, ≈øpeaking of Idolatry. <hi>Spirits,</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>deceive us; they di≈øturb our Life, and our Sleep, in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating them≈øelves into our Bodies, rai≈øe terrour in our inward Thoughts, brui≈øe our Members, impair our Healths, and cau≈øe us Di≈øea≈øes. Tertullian</hi> is of the ≈øame Opinion in <hi>his Book, of Pa≈ø≈øions. The Malice of that inveterate Enemy never leaves him quiet, but it encrea≈øes his Rage when he ≈øees Man fully deliver'd. In his Apologetick,</hi> Chap. 20. he gives a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular explication of what he believes as to the A≈ø≈øaults made by Demons upon Soul and Body. He thinks, <hi>That having a very ≈øubtile and thin E≈ø≈øence, they are ≈øo much the apter to act in an invi≈øible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible manner. He ≈øhows thereby, that he conceives created Spirits as the thine≈øt and ≈øubtile≈øt of all Bodies, and therefore explains his meaning by this Compari≈øon. As it happens that a flame invi≈øible to us burns Corn, and the Fruits of Trees when they are in flower, or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them whil≈øt they blo≈ø≈øom, or corrupts them when
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59386:117"/>the Flower falls off, and they are formed; or as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Air communicates it ≈øelf in a manner unknown to us, ≈øo the ≈øugge≈øtions of the Devil, by a ≈øecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, ≈øeduce the depraved under≈øtanding of</hi> Man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. THE 11th Chapter of this Book was de≈øigned to compare together, the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices of the various Heathens, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits. The natural light that remained in our under≈øtanding, notwith≈øtanding the darkne≈øs in which it has been involv'd by Sin, has been able, without the help of the <hi>Holy writ,</hi> to di≈øcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tho≈øe Opinion and practices, were founded upon true, or fal≈øe grounds. We have ≈øince heard, tho≈øe that acknowledge the Authority of the <hi>Holy writ,</hi> ≈øpeak very differently, by which means, the light of Rea≈øon may be encrea≈øed, and it's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption better'd. Let us now ≈øee what they have done as to this, and how far their endeavours have attained. To that end, we ≈øhall <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> con≈øider, wherein the latter differ from the Heathens, what they have retain'd of <hi>Pagani≈øm;</hi> and la≈øtly in what points they differ from each other; having always
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59386:128"/>regard to that difference of Doctrines, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, or Opinions and Practices, that have been ≈øet down before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The≈øe 3 ≈øorts of People, <hi>Jews, Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> rejecting the plurality of Gods that were believed and adored by the Heathens, and Wor≈øhiping one <hi>Only God,</hi> have overthrown what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the others had invented, concerning confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, inferior, and mean Gods, or familiar Spirits, that were born with Men and outlive them; and at the ≈øame time, have de≈øtroyed whatever Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Witchcrafts were grounded upon ≈øuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by which Men pre≈øume to acquire ≈øome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, and produce ≈øome certain effects. We have found nothing like, among≈øt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> for th√¥ they may have ≈øomthing that appears like it, yet 'tis quite different, as we ≈øhall ≈øhow hereafter. And as to the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> we ≈øee that they unanimou≈øly reject all the≈øe things, and look upon them as delu≈øions and impieties; and as to what the la≈øt, together with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> have retained of the Opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Heathens, it has been taken from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophy of this la≈øt Sect, and accommodated to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or gather'd from it by fal≈øe explications. This I ≈øhall now briefly ≈øhow, concerning the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in general, and the Soul of Man in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. As to the Spirits in general. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That Opinion, that they are partly corporeal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of old by the <hi>Jews, Ch.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5, 11, to 15 By the <hi>Mahometans, Ch.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, 5. and by the <hi>Chri≈øtians, Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5, 14, 15, 23, 24, 31. draws it's Original from the Philo≈øophy of the Heathens, as has been ≈øhown, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14, 16. <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> The Opinion that a≈øcribes ≈øome life and under≈øtanding to the ≈øtars, as to the Sun and Moon;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59386:129"/>whether it be in≈øignificantly expre≈øs'd, as among the <hi>Jews, Ch.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3, 13. or only darkly as among≈øt the <hi>Mahometans;</hi> or propo≈øed as a doubt, as it has been by <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> among≈øt the <hi>Chri≈øtians, Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11, 19. That Opinion, I ≈øay looks very Heatheni≈øh, and differs not much from the <hi>Intelligencies</hi> of <hi>Ari≈øtotle, Ch.</hi> 2, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Nor from the e≈øteem which the modern Heathens have for tho≈øe cele≈øtial Lamps, of which mention has been made, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>

But I mu≈øt ≈øay by the way, that I ≈øee not how tho≈øe that ≈øtill hold, that all Human Souls were created together in the beginning, and afterwards each in his time, introduced into their bodies, could ≈øolidly confute that Opinion of the <hi>Metemp≈øycho≈øis.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> The <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> too ea≈øily credit the apparitions of Souls, which takes place among≈øt the <hi>Jews,</hi> becau≈øe they ≈øuppo≈øe the Souls to wander for a Year, about the bodies from which they are ≈øeparated, <hi>Ch.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect,</hi> 20. Neither can the <hi>Mahometans</hi> reject that Opinion, ≈øince they hold the Souls to be made up of the <hi>Elements, Ch.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. and that after their ≈øeparation from the body, they ≈øee and hear in <hi>Trees, Sect.</hi> 14. As to the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> we find <hi>Ju≈øtin,</hi> one of the Fir≈øt, who ≈øays, that a ≈øeparated Soul may yet operate upon living per≈øons, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. All the Opinions that are related here, are drawn from Philo≈øophy, or mixed with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59386:129"/>Pagani≈øm. But the <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> either taken in its true Sen≈øe, or mi≈ø-interpreted, has given occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the following, which we ≈øhall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The opinion that the Angels have been created from <hi>Fire, Air,</hi> or the mo≈øt ≈øubtile Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the <hi>Jews</hi> only hint. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. but what the <hi>Mahometans</hi> publickly teach, <hi>Chap</hi> 14, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. has likewi≈øe been received by ≈øome <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, 5, 24. becau≈øe they thought it con≈øonant to what is ≈øaid, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. That God makes Spirits his Angels, and flames of fire his Mini≈øters, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.11. that <hi>Elijah</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into Heaven in a Chariot with fiery hor≈øes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.17. That they defended <hi>Eli≈øha,</hi> and that <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 1.4, 5. ≈øaw the likene≈øs of four Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals going out of the mid≈øt of fire; ≈øeveral other mi≈øunder≈øtood pa≈ø≈øages have contributed to the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhing of that Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> The Morning Stars rejoycing together when <hi>God</hi> ceeated the World, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion to <hi>Philo,</hi> as has been ob≈øerved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. to confirm him≈øelf in that Opinion, that the Stars are <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. It likewi≈øe appears, that tho≈øe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Spirits to be corporeal, ground their Opinion upon the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> for having no <hi>Idea</hi> of other Sons of <hi>God,</hi> that fell in love with the Daughters of Men, as is mention'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. but of ≈øuch as are di≈øtingui≈øhed and ≈øeparated from Men: And conceiving not the true nature of Spiritual Beings, they fancied that the <hi>Angels</hi> had begotten tho≈øe <hi>Giants,</hi> of whom 'tis ≈øpoken in that place; add to this, that they could not think that tho≈øe <hi>Nephilim</hi> (which word we Tran≈ølate <hi>Gyants</hi>) ≈øhould be other Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59386:130"/>fall'n Angels, who for that rea≈øon are called by that Name, which ≈øignifies as much as <hi>Rebels.</hi> We have ≈øeen that Opinion received by the <hi>Jews, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. By the <hi>Mahometans, Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and even by ≈øome <hi>Chri≈øtians, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> I grant that it may be inferr'd from thence, that there are <hi>Incubi</hi> and <hi>Succubi,</hi> that is <hi>Devils,</hi> who now in the ≈øhape of <hi>Males,</hi> then of <hi>Females,</hi> lye with Men and Women; that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is ≈øtill now a days much di≈øper≈øed among the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Such are their Sentiments, as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fall of the <hi>Angels;</hi> but as to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction into ≈øeveral Orders, and the ≈øhare they bear in the Government of the World, the ≈øame differences, or very near, are a≈øcribed to them that are atributed to the Heathen Gods and Spirits. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. And that Opinion is ≈øtrengthned by a mi≈øunder≈øtanding of the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> explain them≈øelves clearly and largely upon the different Orders of <hi>Angels. Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, 7, 11. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> treat of it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øedly and ob≈øcurely <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 25, 32. but the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ≈øpeak of it, as tho' it could not be doubted but the <hi>Holy Writ</hi> under≈øtands ≈øuch a <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> by the different names it gives them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> As the Heathens fill'd the Air with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or placed them above, under, and in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the World, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.5, 8. So have the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to <hi>Philo, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5, 12. Neither do the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> di≈øagree from them. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. Suppo≈øing that Opinion to be confirmed in the <hi>Scripture, Ephe≈ø. Chap.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. and by ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages in the <hi>Hi≈øtory of Job.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> They agree together again, in that they acknowledge as many <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> of Men and Nations, as the Heathens did their <hi>Titular Gods.</hi> The Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to this point, may be in ≈øome manner perceived by the quotations that are ≈øet down <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.10. That of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> is more clearly expre≈øs'd, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. But that of the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ≈øtill plainer. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6, 17, 18, 29. to which they have apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pa≈ø≈øages of the <hi>Holy Writ</hi> already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. It goes, even ≈øo, with their belief of the Devils; <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> we hear the <hi>Jews, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, 16. The <hi>Mahometans, Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 21, 31. All ≈øpeaking in a manner the ≈øame Language, as to their Original and Fall. The la≈øt commonly quote the Scripture, <hi>Gene≈ø.</hi> 3.6. and <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 14.12. to maintain their Opinions, but they quote it, no le≈øs adorned with their fooli≈øh fancies, upon the Nature and Creation of Spirits, than the others do by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Tales.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> The Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning the malice of the Devils, their Virtue and Power to hurt, partly appears, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12, 15, 18, 20. And that of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> ≈øeems to be almo≈øt the ≈øame. As to the Thoughts of the <hi>Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians,</hi> they are explained more at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7, 12, 23, 26. In the mean while I find not that they have a≈ø≈øerted any thing contrary to the Opinion of the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. It is convenient to ≈øay al≈øo ≈øomething of Purgatory, the ≈øpring of a va≈øt number of Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Witchcrafts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59386:131"/>1, Whether the <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and ancient <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ≈øpeak clearly upon that ≈øubject, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcurely and doubtful; yet they all agree in e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a purging Fire, or ≈øome ≈øuch other Pain to be endured. Such are the Pains which <hi>the Devils of Torments</hi> inflict upon the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of <hi>Gilgul,</hi> or <hi>the Revolution of Souls,</hi> Chap. 12. Sect. 20. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not remote from that Opinion, <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. <hi>S.</hi> 11. but the <hi>Chri≈øtians, Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 27, 28, 34. or at lea≈øt, part of them, have blown up that Fire from under the A≈øhes, though the others, who≈øe number is far greater, have not the lea≈øt inclination to credit it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. However, tho≈øe that are not altogether remote from them, reject not wholly the Apparitions of the Souls ≈øeparated from their Bodies, nor their various Operations, to which <hi>Ju≈øtin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> have traced out the way for them, as we have ≈øeen, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>S.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. But neither the <hi>Jews</hi> nor the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> carry Exorci≈øms and Conjurations to ≈øo great a height as the Chri≈øtians; in the mean while they all agree in this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are powerful upon the Spirits, by the means of Names, Words, and Signs, that they have ≈øo much virtue as to force them to an≈øwer, to ca≈øt them out, or to turn them off.

It is denyed, that God now works any miracles, but ≈øome are ra≈øhly a≈øcribed to the Devil, that ≈øurpa≈øs all tho≈øe that are mentioned in the <hi>Holy writ.</hi> We believe that there are Angels, and gather from the Holy Scripture, that they encamp about the faithful, and

However it is very rare to hear any one ≈øay, he has ≈øeen an Angel in a vi≈øion, whereas the Devil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears almo≈øt continually. If any thing has been either ≈øignified or foretold, we never believe it to be the Operation of an Angel, but of the Devil: one is po≈ø≈øe≈øt by him, and another bewitch'd; by his means, unknown Tongues are ≈øpoken, ≈øtrange things are ≈øaid, others no le≈øs wonderful are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and the mo≈øt hidden ≈øecrets di≈øcover'd.

However, if this Hi≈øtory be true, it might confirm the ≈øentiments of the Papi≈øts, which ≈øay, That the Souls of the damned appear here upon Earth to the living, to pre≈øent to them, in a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, the torments they ≈øuffer in Hell, to the end, they may bring them by that, to repent and leave off Sinning.</p>

It is al≈øo the common Opinion, that the greate≈øt part of the Souls, are not tho≈øe that are in Paradi≈øe or in Hell; but tho≈øe that dwel between tho≈øe two places, or in Purgatory; for frequent jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from Heaven to Earth would too much di≈øturb the repo≈øe of the Souls, that are there; and Hell keep its Captives too clo≈øely confin'd, to give them ≈øo much liberty; and if it be permitted me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the publick, I ≈øhall ≈øay, it would bring no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Churches Coffers, who≈øe fire of Purgatory makes the pot boyl much better, then all the flames of Hell do, or all the heat of the Cele≈øtial fire.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59386:146"/>and to tho≈øe which belong to them, in any manner what≈øoever, then they do to Strangers, becau≈øe that they hope for ≈øuccor from them, which they cannot hope from others. The Souls of the damned appear particularly to tho≈øe which have been the cau≈øe of their lo≈øs, and of the torments they ≈øuffer.</hi> The apparitions of Devils are made al≈øo with reference to the ruins of tho≈øe they per≈øecute, and their ill will for Mankind, whom they take plea≈øure to torment. On the fir≈øt re≈øpect, tho≈øe who are charged with a greater number of Sins have mo≈øt to ≈øuffer, in the ≈øecond, the mo≈øt Virtuous Men are the more expo≈øed to their attacks.</p>

That which happens to the po≈ø≈øe≈øt, gives occa≈øion to know more particularly what the Devil can act, <hi>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing,</hi> ≈øays <hi>Schottus, is an inevitable torment to Man from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which is in his body, who acts there, and keeps him in his power for a certain time. p.</hi> 521. Which he unfolds more particularly afterwards, but as there has been lately publi≈øhed, an Hi≈øtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun,</hi> and of a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion very famous, ≈øaid to have happened in the Town, the circum≈øtances of which, give a great deal of light upon this point, we will alledge that which will be proper for this ≈øubject, referring a more ≈øtrict examination to our 4th Book, which we ≈øhall not be afraid to do, nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Author appears to be a Prote≈øtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that the mo≈øt part of the ≈øtories this Hi≈øtory contains, are gathered from many Eccle≈øia≈øtick Books, where they are grounded upon Authentick publick acts; and that the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion was declared true by a decree of the Bi≈øhop. It was al≈øo confirm'd by the blood of a Prie≈øt, who was executed for a Magician, after having been condemn'd by an act made by a ≈øentence of Judges Commi≈ø≈øioner ≈øent by the French

               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> That a Man may be po≈ø≈øe≈øt by all ≈øorts of evil Spirits, of what order ≈øoever they may be, for it has been ≈øaid in the 19th <hi>Ch. Sect.</hi> 8. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are divided into different orders, and the Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Devils of <hi>Loudun,</hi> ≈øhews us, that one <hi>Elizabeth Blancheard,</hi> ≈øaid to be po≈ø≈øe≈øt by ≈øix De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; by <hi>A≈øtaroh</hi> and the coal of uncleanne≈øs, by the order of Angels; by <hi>Belzebub</hi> and the Lion of Hell, of the order of Archangels; by <hi>Perou</hi> and <hi>Marou,</hi> of the order of Cherubins. <hi>p.</hi> 255.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That all per≈øons of what Sex, Age, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or Religion ≈øoever they may be, what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind of life they lead, either good or bad, may be po≈ø≈øe≈øt by Devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> Alth√¥ the mo≈øt part are po≈ø≈øe≈øt without their con≈øent, and in ≈øpight of them, by evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it is believed, ≈øometimes, that there are ≈øome which con≈øent to it, there are tho≈øe to whom are attributed Spirits of <hi>Pithon,</hi> who divine by means of the Devil. <hi>Schottus p.</hi> 550.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. This Author explains to us more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely, in what manner the Devil enters into Men, and how he works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> Granting he can cloath all ≈øorts of bodies as he plea≈øes, and according as God permits him, he can ≈øometimes go and come, enter into Man, and come out invi≈øibly, and ≈øometimes, al≈øo vi≈øibly and under the figures of ≈ømall Bea≈øts, or in≈øects, as Ants, Flies, Spiders, or under tho≈øe little birds. This is the common Opinions of Popi≈øh writers, alth√¥ <hi>Schottus</hi> is not very much for it. <hi>p.</hi> 539. But he is in the wrong, for here's a proof, at lea≈øt, as to his invi≈øible going in, and coming out, in the <hi>Hi≈øtory of the Devils of</hi> Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun; where it is ≈øaid, that a Devil called <hi>Bihemot,</hi> being gone out to ≈øeek a new Covenant, the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59386:147"/>Angel of the Nun that he po≈ø≈øe≈øt, ≈øeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and bound him for a Month, under the Picture of St. <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> in the Church. <hi>p.</hi> 405. And that this Religious fancyed, as tho I know not what ≈øhould have gone out from her head, which remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her, as the Devil retired farther; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Devil him≈øelf declared, that after having been tied in his body not to part from it, he had at pre≈øent, as well as his companions, the liberty of coming too and fro. <hi>p.</hi> 408.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second. Schottus</hi> howevever agrees, that evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits give to the po≈ø≈øe≈øt, the faculty of ≈øpeaking ≈øtrange languages that they never learned, and of revealing ≈øecrets, which they could not know of them≈øelves. <hi>p.</hi> 540. So it is that the Nun of <hi>Loudun</hi> ≈øpoke La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin the be≈øt he could, a≈ø≈øuring that ≈øhe had never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. <hi>Hi≈øtory of the Devils of</hi> Loudun. And ≈øo it is that the Demons di≈øcovered to the Je≈øuit <hi>surin,</hi> ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret matters, in his thought or in his per≈øon. <hi>p.</hi> 273. or that they went to ki≈øs the right hand of one of the exorci≈øts, for that the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> had ≈øo de≈øired it, and had declared his de≈øire to another exorci≈øt. <hi>p.</hi> 297. Upon which one of them hath writ, that the Devils an≈øwered often to interrogatories, made to them by the exorci≈øts, without expre≈ø≈øing them otherwi≈øe then by the inferior direction of their thoughts. <hi>p.</hi> 104. See there the la≈øt effort of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to divine thoughts hidden, and in no ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third. Schottus</hi> ≈øays in other places, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal operations of the Devil, are made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the po≈ø≈øe≈øt, and that they art little or nothing upon the Soul; and that for this rea≈øon, they cannot make a Man loo≈øe his Faith, nor Hope, nor Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>p.</hi> 534. But the Devil <hi>I≈øaacarum</hi> who knew more of it then our Author, ≈øays, that <hi>Behemet</hi> had not only vex'd <hi>Job</hi> in his body, but that he had al≈øo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59386:147"/>troubled his Soul: and that it is for this rea≈øon, that he ≈øinned not <hi>in all that he ≈øaid: Hi≈øtory of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of</hi> Loudun. Pag. 374.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. See what the Devil can do, and what he does very often, according to the opinions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks;</hi> be it that he makes u≈øe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry of Men in the≈øe occa≈øions, or that he u≈øes them nor; tho≈øe that he imployes in his Mini≈øtry, are called Sorcerers, Enchanters, and Magicians. 'Tis ≈øtedfa≈øtly believed, that tho≈øe People have given them≈øelves to the Devil, and have covenanted with him, and ≈øigned it with their own Blood; That the Devil on his part is ob≈øerved to do all they de≈øire during the cour≈øe of their life, and that the Magicians on their part give them≈øelves to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and put them≈øelves into his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion all their days, or for a certain time that they have mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed together. If you would ≈øee an example very particular of ≈øuch a contract, you need but read the Hi≈øtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun, Pag.</hi> 271. but you cannot read it without being amazed. The Magicians, in con≈øequence of their Covenants, are to enjoy a great deal of plea≈øure, which will be procured to them by the Devil, to do a great deal of mi≈øchief to others, and cau≈øe a great deal of damage to their Cattle, and to their other Goods. Their plea≈øure con≈øi≈øts in ≈øolemn A≈ø≈øemblies, which are held in the night in places the Devil appoints, and where he appears in all ≈øorts of Figures: there they dance, drink and eat in exce≈øs, and the Men and Women mix them≈øelves carnally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with the Devil him≈øelf, who for that purpo≈øe, ≈øometimes transforms him≈øelf into a Man, ≈øometimes into a Woman. The Wizards and Witches are tran≈øported thro the' Windows, to places where they a≈ø≈øemble, by virtue of a certain Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they anoint them≈øelves with; they ride
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59386:148"/>mounted upon the Devil, as upon a Hor≈øe, for he is obliged to ≈øerve them; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe he transforms him≈øelf into a Goat, or ≈øome other Animal. Sometimes there are in tho≈øe A≈ø≈øemblies, ≈øtrange Sacrifices, for the Hi≈øtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun</hi> writes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 153. That they force the Devil Leviathan to ≈øurrender a Contract written upon the fle≈øh of the Heart of an Infant, taken in a <hi>Sabbat,</hi> held at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and of the A≈øhes of a burnt <hi>Ho≈øt.</hi>

The di≈øorders that they cau≈øe to Men, are to mi≈øchief their per≈øons, or their Cattle, to ≈øtir up Tempe≈øts, to ≈øpoil the Corn of the field, to breed Di≈øputes, to di≈øturb the Society of Men, by a thou≈øand means; ≈øome times they do good with an eye to proper advantage; for ≈øome Money they di≈øcover things lo≈øt; they declare if one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, or if not, and by whom it has been; they teach what mu≈øt be done to cure them that are ≈øo, or they cure them them≈øelves. Of this, <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Book, intituled <hi>Daemonamania</hi> ≈øhall fully in≈øtruct, the reader, that will take the pains to read him. For no Authors are more large upon that ≈øubject, than he and <hi>Delrio.</hi> In the mean while we will look into their Sentiments, related by <hi>Schotus,</hi> more plainly than in their own Books.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. This Author ≈øays further, <hi>That from the con≈øideration of the ends the Magicians have,</hi> viz. <hi>to act marvelous things by the Devils power, chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed three ≈øorts of Witchcraft; for they have ≈øometimes, no other end but to acquire the Art and Indu≈øtry of producing miraculous effects for their proper advantage or plea≈øure; or that of others: they ≈øometimes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to di≈øcover things to come, or to know things pa≈øt, and ≈øuch pre≈øent at are ≈øecret and hidden, and cannot be di≈øcovered by any human power; ≈øometimes they have no other end but to acquire the Power, the Art, and the Means to hurt Men.</hi> This is not the place to tell what the Papi≈øts believe Magicians are able to do, and what in effect they do; becau≈øe, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapter, one has ≈øeen what is the power that Popery attributes to the Devil, who are likewi≈øe capable to effect by the Mini≈øtry of Men, that is to ≈øay, of Wizards and Witches, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Leagues, all that they effect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>

The≈øe two Opinions ≈øo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ought to be attributed to two Scots; to the one an Illu≈øtrious <hi>King of Great Brittain,</hi> which is, <hi>King James,</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Fir≈øt <hi>King of England</hi> of that name; and the other, to one of his Scotch Subjects, a Scot by birth as by name, being call'd <hi>Reynard Scot;</hi> the King held the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as to the popular Opinion of Witchcraft, and Apparition of Spirits, which his ≈øubject had already confuted. <hi>John Wierus</hi> who lived in the begining of the Reformation made by means of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> had from that time publi≈øhed his Opinion upon the delu≈øion of Spirits and upon the impo≈øtures of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and he had taken a part which held in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between tho≈øe two Opinions; ≈øo <hi>King James</hi> in his Book of <hi>Demonology</hi> conte≈øted with the≈øe two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, according to his expre≈øs Declaration in the Preface.</p>

In the fourth Chapter of the ≈øecond Book, the King puts for certain, that evil Spirits may carry Men through the Air, or a≈ø≈øume divers forms, to vi≈øit the Magicians, when they are in Pri≈øon. In the ≈øeventh Chapter, he ≈øays, that in the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Pagani≈øm, there was a great many more Apparitions; but that it was ob≈øerved, that ≈øince this la≈øt Reformation of the Chri≈øtian Church, there have been fewer Apparitions, and a great many more Witchcrafts. Concerning the apparitions of Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Phantoms, of which he treats in the Third Book, there are ≈øcarce any kind to which this Prince gives not credit, even to <hi>Incubu≈ø≈øes</hi> and <hi>Succubu≈ø≈øes,</hi> which are Spirits, who, as Men, mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves carnally with Women, and as Women with Men. In reference to the po≈ø≈øe≈øt, the King agrees that the Popi≈øh Prie≈øt may drive out the Devil; but upon the proofs that he has to convince one of the crime of Magick, he only ≈øays, there mu≈øt be no le≈øs than twelve witne≈ø≈øes, among≈øt which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Infants, infamous People, and even tho≈øe that are taken to be Magicians.</p>

It is what
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59386:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>is ≈øeen, e≈øpecially in the works of two Engli≈øh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who explain them≈øelves more plainly, and preci≈øely than all others upon this matter, which they treat from the foundation; whereas others keep the ≈øame language only by occa≈øion, and when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other ≈øubjects, they are obliged to ≈øpeak of them.

The fir≈øt Edition of it has been al≈øo in Engli≈øh at <hi>London</hi> in 1661. after the death of the Author.

               <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>To ≈øecure the Per≈øon of the Magician, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil imprints a mark either under the Eye-lids, or between the Buttocks, or the Pallat of the Mouth, that it may not be perceived in tho≈øe places. The Author believes that there are none exempt from carrying it: It is for this Rea≈øon, that the Judges order the whole Body of tho≈øe that are accu≈øed of this Crime, to be ≈øhaved, to know the place that is marked, as I have told you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Conditions of the≈øe Contracts imply that they ≈øhall renounce God, and acknowledge Satan, and adore him for their God, and in Recompence he ≈øhall

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>After the Covenant has been thus mutually agreed upon, the Magician, the morrow after, ≈øacrifices to the Devil, a Dog, a Cat, or a Hen, that belongs to him, by which means the Contract is confirmed a new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Afterwards the Devil cau≈øes in proper time and place, all the Magicians to a≈ø≈øemble where ever he pre≈øcribes; there he makes every one of them give an account of the Mi≈øchiefs he has done by his Power and Means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He ≈øometimes takes the trouble to get them together, a≈ø≈øuming a human ≈øhape for that purpo≈øe, and making him≈øelf known to the Magicians only: At other times he imploys ≈øome of them to go and Convene the A≈ø≈øembly, ≈øhewing them the time and place: This A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly is not always general, ≈øometimes there are but a certain number which he has cho≈øen to plea≈øe him≈øelf.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If there are ≈øome, who through weakne≈øs of Body cannot go, he gives them a Stick, or a Hor≈øe, of ≈øome Oyntment to anoint them≈øelves, by the virtue of which being become invi≈øible, he tran≈øports them through the Air.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That he often appears in human ≈øhape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he ≈øometimes troubles, and ca≈øts ≈øuch a Mi≈øt over the Sen≈øes of tho≈øe that are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with him, that they fancy to have been in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, and to have acted ≈øeveral things, though there is no truth or reality in the≈øe Imaginations.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He rejects the Opinion of tho≈øe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the power of the Devil has no longer any effect upon the Magicians, nor can act in their behalf, as ≈øoon as they are in the Hands and Power of Ju≈øtice; on the contrary, he ≈øuppo≈øes, that the virtue of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft may be exerted even in Pri≈øons; and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Devil breaks there the Necks of tho≈øe who belong to him: The≈øe are <hi>Daneus</hi>'s his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59386:159"/>greate≈øt part of Divines con≈øult him for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. That it is from him they learn what they di≈øcover to other Men of things pre≈øent, things hidden; as when there has been ≈øomething ≈øtoll'n, or ≈øome body bewitch'd, they declare the Thief or Magician. They likewi≈øe a≈øcribe to him ≈øome knowledge of the Thoughts of Men, ≈øince they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that he di≈øturbs and ≈øeduces them, and that he incites them to mi≈øchief. For that is properly what we under≈øtand when we pray in our Churches for tho≈øe that are tempted and troubled in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences. There are no errors produced, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øes no Here≈øies in the Church, it is not afflicted with any per≈øecution, but the Devil has contributed thereto. All the places of Scripture, that ≈øpeak of the Devil, are under≈øtood with relation to the≈øe Ideas: And it is upon the≈øe interpretations that the≈øe Opinions are grounded. It is al≈øo by the ≈øame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that not only the <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> but almo≈øt all the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Writers a≈ø≈øert, That it is not allow'd to con≈øult the Devil, who is the enemy of God, and of Men, nor to ≈øeek his help: They however agree, that the <hi>Pagan Oracles</hi> have not always been given by the Devil, but that often they have been the effect of the impo≈øtures of Prie≈øts, which has ≈øo often appear'd, that it is impo≈ø≈øible not to know it.</p>

As to the means which Magicians, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, and Inchanters make u≈øe of, ≈øcarce is there a per≈øon of good Sen≈øe, that believes they are effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of them≈øelves, but they will have it to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Devil, who operates all that tho≈øe mi≈øerable wretches imagine to act; and that the Covenants made between him and them, oblige him to execute that which they require of him; provided only, that they make u≈øe of Signs and that they imploy circum≈øtances de≈øtin'd for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, ≈øuch as he has taught them. It is very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ob≈øerved, as is believed, that tho≈øe Leagues are made two ways, which I ≈øhall expre≈øs in the words of <hi>Sennertus,</hi> taken from his Treati≈øe upon this Que≈øtion. <hi>Whether one may be render'd invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to the point of a Sword, and to Mu≈øquets?</hi> where he ≈øays, <hi>That the Contract with the Devil is of two kinds, mediate or immediate; expre≈øs or tacite. The immediate, or expre≈øs Contract, is when any makes u≈øe of means, that he has been immediately furni≈øhed with by the Devil. The mediate or tacite Contract is, when one makes u≈øe of the means, which in truth have been
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59386:160"/>ordain'd by the Devil; but not having been ≈øupply'd by the Devil him≈øelf, comes to him by the hand of ≈øome other per≈øon; which is directly contrary to the Law of God, that forbids us to have other Gods but him:</hi> For he ≈øays a little further, <hi>The con≈øent is not altogether excluded from the tacite agreement, becau≈øe, who≈øoever is not as yet deprived of Rea≈øon, as not to avoid the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of Rocks, or the mouth of a Pit, he cannot but ≈øee that ≈øuch Words and Characters have not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves any virtue; and that by con≈øequence, before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king u≈øe of them, we are obliged to examin by what virtue they may produce ≈øuch effects: for if one neglects to do it, it is certain a tacite Contract with the Devil, who has promi≈øed to execute all the clau≈øes and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his writing in favour of tho≈øe who make u≈øe of the Words and Characters therein contained, in con≈øequence of which, he who makes u≈øe of it, cannot pretend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf innocent of the crime of Magick.</hi> Such is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi>'s opinion, and as I may judge from my own experience, will not be confuted by our Doctors, for I hear them generally hold ≈øpeaking the ≈øame Language.

They hold that the≈øe la≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the in≈øpiration of the Devil, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbs the imagination of Man, and repre≈øents to him fearful Figures, to di≈øquiet or fright him, or to tran≈øport him for ≈øome time into ≈øome place
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59386:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>where he plea≈øes: as we have ≈øeen before, that he tran≈øports the Witches to their ≈øeveral meetings. In con≈øequence of this Doctrine, there are ≈øome of opinion, that the Dream that <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Wife ≈øuffered ≈øo much becau≈øe of Chri≈øt, was a Diabolick Dream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. But I find not any of the≈øe Doctors who have heretofore ever attributed ≈øo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding and Power to the Devil; as to the knowledge and effects already de≈øcribed, as <hi>Reynold Schot</hi> has, before quoted. We have at this time <hi>Anthony Van Dalen,</hi> who a≈øcribes no more to him in his Book of <hi>Oracles:</hi> the≈øe two Authors hold that there is no other efficient cau≈øe of all the things which are practi≈øed, or which are operated, but the impo≈øtures of Men; the Devil having no part in them. I learn al≈øo, whil≈øt I am taken up in this pre≈øent Work, that the mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible among us, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute but very little power and knowledge to the Devil: and that there are a great many more than I conceived, who, as to the actions of the po≈ø≈øe≈øt and bewitched are of the ≈øame opinion with Mr. <hi>Daillon,</hi> who in a <hi>French</hi> Book concerning Demons, maintains all that which is contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, touching evil and unclean Spirits, is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe to be under≈øtood, than of certain Di≈øea≈øes to which the <hi>Jews</hi> u≈øed to give ≈øuch names, believing, however that it might happen, evil Spirits medl'd with them at the ≈øame time. There's lately come to my hands very conveniently, a little Book of Mr. <hi>Orchard</hi>'s an <hi>Engli≈øhman,</hi> Preacher in the <hi>New-Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> as I am told, in which the ancient and common opinion upon this ≈øubject is confuted, as being directly oppo≈øite to the Doctrine and belief of the Prote≈øtant Churches.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. But let us leave off ≈øpeaking of the≈øe People, becau≈øe, that of one ≈øide there is no nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity here to handle them and becau≈øe I intend to do it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59386:161"/>afterwards. It is not nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øpeak of them here, becau≈øe my intention is not to ≈øet down here what is not ≈øaid of the Devil, and what is not attributed to him; but my de≈øign is to relate that which is ≈øaid of him, and to examine whether it be true or no. 'Tis ≈øufficient for me to hold the la≈øt Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Writer, becau≈øe I am much aver≈øe from maintaining the opinion which a≈øcribes ≈øo much power and virtue to Spirits; and e≈øpecially to the bad. And further, I ≈øhall be obliged to enter the Li≈øt with <hi>Schot, Van Dalen,</hi> and many others, who oppo≈øe the common belief that they had of this Power, when I ≈øhall come afterwards to examine the rea≈øons and proofs upon which it is founded. However, before I fini≈øh this Fir≈øt Part, I ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear≈øe all that has been ≈øaid, and compare the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Infidels with tho≈øe of the Chri≈øtians.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. I have from time to time conferr'd the Opinions that I have related, fir≈øt tho≈øe of the Ancient and modern Pagans, in the 11th Chapter, and afterwards tho≈øe of the Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and Chri≈øtians of the ≈øix fir≈øt Ages, in the 17th Chapter. There remains now to compare tho≈øe of the Papi≈øts and Prote≈øtants, after which we will confer them all together; to that end, we mu≈øt break off the order that we have kept hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and begin with the la≈øt; they will furni≈øh us with very certain proof, that there is no Opinion to which the World is more engag'd, than to that which is almo≈øt generally every where taught and received concerning Spirits; for the Prote≈øtants have retained all that which cannot be look't upon as a pure invention of Popery in particular; and there are even ≈øome, who≈øe belief upon this ≈øubject, go farther than tho≈øe of the Papi≈øts. The Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in general believe all that is not particular to the Jews and Pagans; the Jews and the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans believe all that, according to them, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtant with the belief of one only God; ≈øome will tell me perhaps, that we mu≈øt not wonder at it, and that naturally it ought to be ≈øo. This is what
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59386:162"/>we have now to examine, and there will be as yet room to ≈øpeak more plainly and fully afterwards.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Notwith≈øtanding it is convenient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti≈øe the Reader, that relating here the difference or the conformity of the Opinions of all Nations, I mean only the Opinions of the more learned and are remarked among≈øt the Doctors, or who are taken for wi≈øemen in their Country, and capable of in≈øtructing others in matter of Faith<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I intend not to ≈øpeak of particular Opinions, but of tho≈øe generally received, taught, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by practices; for as to the common People, either Papi≈øts, Jews, or Pagans, they know nothing for the mo≈øt part, but a little by hear-≈øay; ≈øo that there is no relying upon them, and it is ≈øure without mi≈øtake, that for the mo≈øt part, what the mo≈øt illiterate believe and practice, is contrary to the ≈øen≈øe of Divines, and of all tho≈øe that under≈øtand any thing in the Holy Scripture. I will have nothing to do with them upon this ≈øubject, having often tryed my ≈øelf how many follies our own People ≈øay and believe, upon this account.</p>

So it is nece≈ø≈øary to e≈øtabli≈øh here as certain and undoubted, that every Opinion that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Pagani≈øm as from it's Original, cannot at the ≈øame time be founded upon the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is true, there never was a Doctor either Chri≈øtian or Jew, who has not applied ≈øome place in Scripture to what he has propo≈øed, but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion is to know, whether the applications were ju≈øt, and whether the Scripture may be expounded in the ≈øen≈øe put upon it; for it may be that the≈øe Doctors having their imagination fill'd with their own Ideas, believe in reading, to ≈øee things there which are not there, and that their own prejudice cau≈øes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59386:163"/>follows, where I remark briefly what every Sect rejects, and what every one admits; and afterwards what the one have borrowed of others, and what they have retained to this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Alth√¥ the Prote≈øtant Churches, with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon con≈øent, deny Purgatory and all the places where they put Souls, except Paradi≈øe and Hell; the≈øe two points, are Opinions of Popery. There has been ≈øome mention made of them among≈øt the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chri≈øtians, neither the Jews nor the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans reject them, and they have been taken from Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øm<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Who≈øoever rejects them, he mu≈øt reject to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the Doctrines and practices that are grounded upon them. For this rea≈øon,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> We do not believe among us, that the Souls of the Decea≈øed are never wandering, nor that they appear to the living, under any figures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever, to obtain help and comfort from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> It is not believed that the Souls of the ble≈ø≈øed come back from Heaven upon Earth, nor that tho≈øe of the damned come back from Hell. It is not believed, that either the one or the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to Men, to comfort or afright them; and far le≈øs as yet, that the living can make agreements together, to come back after Death and vi≈øit tho≈øe they had agreed with, who have ≈øurviv'd them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> By this rea≈øon, the Dead are never ask'd any Que≈øtions, nor any religious wor≈øhip paid to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. The Virtue of Conjurations is likewi≈øe unknown among us, either to drive the Souls of the decea≈øed, or to expel evil Spirits, with whom any ≈øhould be tormented. No other means is known ≈øufficient for this effect, but Prayer and fa≈øting, taught by our Saviour <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt, St. Matthew,</hi> Ch. 17 v. 21.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59386:163"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi> For this Rea≈øon it is not believed, that there is any body either Prie≈øt or Exorci≈øt, which is authori≈øed to make ≈øuch Conjurations, nor ought to meddle with them, alth√¥ a like practice was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the fir≈øt time of Chri≈øtianity; whether it had ≈øucce≈øs by the power of God, or it was the meer effect of the Artifices of Men, and that it has been a cu≈øtom among the Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans and all the Pagans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> Neither is it believed, words, names, ≈øigns, ge≈øtures, and po≈øtures, even th√¥ they were taken from the Holy Scripture, have any power for this effect, either of them≈øelves or in≈øtitution of the Church; becau≈øe ≈øhe has not received any power from God, to give her Authority as to this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> They Conjure not the Devil in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm of Children, as the Papi≈øts to do; the Lutherans do the like, but not with the ≈øame intent, as the fir≈øt, that is, that the Devil is in the Infant, or that he is driven out by the Virtue of words, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; for they only retain this practice, becau≈øe of it's antiquity, it being indifferent of it ≈øelf, at lea≈øt ≈øuch is their pretence or excu≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Now that the Doctrines of the Prote≈øtants have been conferr'd with tho≈øe of Popery in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it remains to ≈øee what difference there is between the Chri≈øtians in general, and the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The Pagans, the Jews, and the Ancient Chri≈øtians have believed that there is another kind of Spirits, which are placed between God and the Angels, or which are in ≈øome ≈øort corporeal, but it is not granted any more at this time by Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> Likewi≈øe it is not u≈øual among them, to a≈ø≈øociate God, or the Spirits to the Stars. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, it was an Opinion purely Pagan; and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59386:164"/>ouching Spirits, it was a Jewi≈øh Opinion; I know not whether it may be ≈øaid, that the Ancient Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had not ≈øome tincture of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> This difference of nature in the Angels, propo≈øed by the Jews, is not believed any more; it draws its Original from Ancient Pagani≈øm, and is admitted to this day, by the modern Pagans; It's true, that the Papi≈øts acknowledge a difference of Order, but they put none in the e≈ø≈øence of the≈øe Spirits. Likewi≈øe, th√¥ they make generally appear all ≈øorts of Spirits, neverthele≈øs the difference is only in re≈øpect of places, of Per≈øons, and effects, as we have ≈øhewn more fully, <hi>Ch.</hi> 19 <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.2.3. but it is no way in re≈øpect of their nature, nor of their Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> There is not a Chri≈øtian, be he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant or Papi≈øt, who believes, that Spirits are truly capable of engendering; which is neverthele≈øs the common belief of all the Pagans, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among the Jews, and has not been confuted ≈øufficiently by the primitive Chri≈øtians, among whom are found, ≈øome who have expre≈øly taught it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. But the Pagans differ from the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Chri≈øtians chiefly in two points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That they mix and confound together the ≈øupream God with other ≈øuperior and inferior Gods good and bad; and al≈øo the Souls of Men with all tho≈øe Gods, in ≈øuch a confu≈øed manner, that it is impo≈ø≈øible to comprehend any thing, and that it is a Labyrinth from whence they cannot extricate them≈øelves. On the contrary, the Jews and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans agree with the Chri≈øtians, in this point, that there is one only God, and that all that is be≈øides him has been created by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> In that, that not only they make no great difficulty to deify Men, but that they make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo the Gods return to the condition of Men, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59386:164"/>that they believe there are Men, the i≈ø≈øue of the Gods; there are ≈øome of the≈øe errors, which the Papi≈øts cannot boa≈øt of being entirely free from; for they may rea≈øonably be reproached, that they have ≈øub≈øtituted their Saints to the≈øe imaginary Gods, and to tho≈øe Demons of the Pagans; That they ≈øpeak of Saints as the Pagans do of their Gods; that they make them act in the ≈øame manner, that the≈øe fal≈øe Deities were ≈øuppo≈øed to act. But pure Chri≈øtianity, ≈øuch as has been in all times upon this point, never make Gods a Man, nor never rai≈øes Man to the dignity of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. There is notwith≈øtanding ≈øome point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Prote≈øtants are not agreed, and upon which, neverthele≈øs the Papi≈øts, the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, the Jews, the Mahometans, and all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans agree, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tutelary Gods of the Pagans, who were the guardian Angels in the fir≈øt Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. We have lately ≈øeen they are admitted without conte≈øtation among the Papi≈øts; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants in general, are not di≈øpo≈øed to receive this Opinion; tho≈øe of the profe≈ø≈øion of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Swi≈ø≈øerland,</hi> reject it; and neverthele≈øs there are ≈øome, but very few, that admit it, or at lea≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not that there are ≈øufficient rea≈øons to oppo≈øe it; we ≈øhall examine afterwards, which is the ≈øounde≈øt of the≈øe Opinions. In the mean while we mu≈øt take notice before hand, that what the Papi≈øts teach upon this ≈øubject, together with ≈øome of other Chri≈øtians that are not of their Communion, relates more to the light and knowledge which they ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that tho≈øe Spirits communicate to them, than real help they can expect in their actions, and in their manner of living; for it is rarely ≈øeen, or to ≈øay better, it is never ≈øeen, that the People a≈øcribe a con≈øiderable deliverance, or a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, that befal them to an Angel, either their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59386:165"/>keeper or their enemy; but they never fail to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it immediatly to the providence of God; or if they ≈øometimes turn their Eyes to another ≈øide, the Papi≈øts as to their particular refer all the good that happens to them, to the protection of ≈øome great Saint, e≈øpecially to that of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but the Prote≈øtants, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øeem to favour the belief of the Popi≈øh Saints, would rather ≈øay, if occa≈øion ≈øerves, that the Devil was the Author of it,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. There is al≈øo a difference to be taken notice of, betwixt the Heathens on one ≈øide, the Jews and the Mahometans on the other, and all the Chri≈øtians on another; it is chiefly in the practice of Witchcraft and Divination; which, according to the principles of the fir≈øt, is a laudable practice in it ≈øelf, alth√¥ often abu≈øed, as a great many good things are; according to the principles of the ≈øecond, it is only allow'd and u≈øeful in many occa≈øions; and according to the la≈øt it is directly oppo≈øite to Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. The rea≈øon of it is, that the Pagans hold for Gods, or at lea≈øt for Mini≈øters and Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Gods, Spirits, which are lookt upon by Chri≈øtians as unpure Spirits; and that the Jews and the Mahometans cau≈øe to proceed from the Virtue of the <hi>Caballa<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi> and the influences of the Stars, whatever the Chri≈øtians take to be Magick, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, or Enchantments. It is true, that in the time of Ancient Pagani≈øm, the Mathematicians have been put into the rank of Poi≈øoners, and that both were treated as per≈øons equally pernicious, to whom it was forbidden to exerci≈øe their art, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. But the occa≈øion of the≈øe prohibitions, was only founded upon the ill u≈øe that was made of this Art, which had been before not only permitted, but even much e≈øteem'd. At this time the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have no longer any aver≈øion for the name of Mathematician, but that of Poy≈øoner never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any good interpretation; no that words are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59386:165"/>here to be di≈øputed, for 'tis of things that we treat; and we are to examine them, and not words. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there will be occa≈øion to have ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, in our third Book; where without doubt, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øpeak fully of the≈øe terms, and of many others.</p>

                  <hi>Second.</hi> That there natures are different, ≈øome ab≈øolutely ≈øub≈øi≈øting without body, as Angels; and others being united to a body, as Souls.</p>

I grant it; But what have they taught upon this ≈øubject? All that we have reported before in the ten Chapters, that are betwixt the fir≈øt and twelfth: There every one may ≈øee what it is; what are their uncertainty and contradictions; how different and oppo≈øite among them are their practices. What foundation can be laid upon a Philo≈øophy, which has not ≈øought but to accommodate it ≈øelf to capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and prejudiced People; and which con≈øi≈øts almo≈øt in nothing el≈øe but the Tricks of Prie≈øts. Be≈øides, it is not a pure Philo≈øophy that has been the original and foundation of Pagan Religions; but the Philo≈øophy ≈øuch as it has been comprehended and under≈øtood by the People; that is to ≈øay, very ill in part or in the whole, mixed with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and great ignorance. The fear cau≈øed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ≈øurpri≈øing objects, and the blind love every one has for his own Notions, produced in that perturbation, drive Men to ≈øeek the means to appea≈øe a power from which proceed tho≈øe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary objects, and which is the cau≈øe of tho≈øe evils they are not able to re≈øi≈øt.

We mu≈øt therefore imagine, that there are not any of tho≈øe that addicted them≈øelves to Philo≈øophy, who from their youth had not been bred in the Opinions, and exerci≈øe of the Religion of their Ance≈øtors; So that they owe unto the Schools the Prejudices that they had thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øwallowed.

But to our great ≈øhame, mo≈øt part of us, as well as of other Sects, that pretend a Veneration for the Holy Writ, ≈øearch not in it after its Sen≈øe, being ≈øatisfied with the vulgar Interpretations, and ≈øuch as they have received from others.

If we de≈øire more particularly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the Notion of the≈øe things is formed in Men of Learning, by the means of Learning it ≈øelf, and how it is increa≈øed; I am ready to declare what I have ob≈øerved for a long time, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments I have made. The fir≈øt prejudices of Man are as ancient as his knowledge, and begin from his mo≈øt tender youth the≈øe two ways.

Even their Parents, and ≈øome of their

The Names of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> are not half ≈øo much u≈øed in tho≈øe occa≈øions, where they would be ≈øo lawful and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; but on the contrary they ≈øeem to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd from the Mouths of mo≈øt Men.</p>

When Youths are put to School, they read almo≈øt nothing from the lowe≈øt to the highe≈øt Forms, in the Greek and Latin Books, but what concerns the Demons and their Effects, as they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented by the Heathens. They are imbu'd with that Science before they attain to tho≈øe that relate to the u≈øe of this Life, and that are call'd <hi>Faculties.</hi> The infernal Gods and Godde≈ø≈øes; as <hi>Pluto, Vulcan, Pro≈øerpine,</hi> are known very early, and grown fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Youth, before they are ≈øufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed in the knowledge of the true God. They greedily imbibe the Epi≈øtles, Poetry, and Hi≈øtories of the antient Greeks and Romans, where a frequent mention is made of the vertue of Dreams, Miracles, Apparitions, Spectres, coming out of Subterraneous Places, as Caverns, or de≈øcending from high, as the Air. Tho≈øe Relations read with plea≈øure, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved almo≈øt as the Go≈øpel; or rather are to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead the Go≈øpel.

They choo≈øe the Exerci≈øes they are to make, the Le≈ø≈øons they are to learn, and the Books they are to Read; which they do not ≈øo much with an intent of Under≈øtanding the Holy Scripture; as of informing them≈øelves of the Controver≈øies among≈øt the principal Sects, the particular Opinions of our Doctors, who are already but too much divided, and who≈øe divisions are but too great.

I ≈øay, that the Character of Philo≈øophy, ≈øuch as is learned in the Schools, pours it ≈øelf upon all the Interpretations and Tran≈ølations that are of the Holy Writ. It was the Opinion of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> that the four Elements; Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, were included within one another as by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, reaching from the Center to the highe≈øt place of the Univer≈øe: So as that the Earth was the lowe≈øt, being mixed with Water in its Superficies, and the Air above it ≈øurrounding the Terraqueous Globe. The≈øe Propo≈øitions are granted by all. But that Philo≈øopher al≈øo believes that Fire ≈øurrounds the Air, as the Cele≈øtial Heavens divided into ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vaults do Fire. The≈øe Vaults, to which the Sun, Moon and Stars are fa≈øtned, and are of a ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and incorruptible matter in them≈øelves, ≈øurround one another, and turn about us every year, every month, and every day, by the vertue of ≈øome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirits, call'd <hi>A≈ø≈øi≈øting Forms.</hi> Tho≈øe that hold that Opinion for probable, are very apt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded, that the wicked Spirits dwell in the Air; becau≈øe the ≈øuperiour Spheres are too pure for them. When therefore tho≈øe ≈øort of Men hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioning <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 2.1. <hi>Or the Spiritual Wickedne≈øs in high Places,</hi> Ch. 6.12. they doubt not but St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the Opinion of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> and that by the≈øe words of the Holy Scripture, the wicked Spirits mu≈øt be under≈øtood.

They are not di≈øpo≈øed to fill the Air with Spirits, nor to fix them to Stars, nor to confound Spirits and Stars together. But the mi≈øchief is, as I have already hinted, that few Learned give up them≈øelves to that part of the Sciences, tho' it is the mo≈øt u≈øeful and beautiful of all.</p>

All the≈øe prejudices with which we have been once fill'd, which have been rooted in us more and more, by the ways already alleag'd, which have grown by the new nouri≈øhment they daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which have neither been bani≈øhed, nor weaken'd by the endeavours of a better informed Judgment; all the≈øe prejudices, I ≈øay, are no where more ≈øen≈øible than in the ≈øubject we treat of. And therefore we have de≈øtin'd this Fir≈øt Book, to e≈øtabli≈øh this Truth, and make it very plain; to the end, it might be clearly perceived, that all tho≈øe Opinions concerning the Devils, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, and Witchcraft, draw their fir≈øt Original from the Heathens, who communicated them to the Jews, during the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Captivity, where they had more conver≈øation with the Philo≈øophers, than in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whil≈øt they liv'd ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all other Nations of the Earth.

Whence comes it, that we publickly laugh at (both in our di≈øcour≈øes and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,) the ≈øham miracles of the former, as being meer delu≈øions and trifles, and that we approve, both by our words and our Books, the narrations that the latter make of the wonders ≈øeen among≈øt them, and that we quote them as true, th√¥ they be of the ≈øame matter and weight with the others? The antiquity of tho≈øe Authors and of the times in which they have written, has it ≈øo much power and efficacy? and mu≈øt we more ea≈øily credit ≈øtories, becau≈øe they are ≈øaid to have happen'd a long while ago, and in far remote Countries?

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59386:175"/>the Devil. By which means it was ea≈øy to in≈øinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that the Devil intere≈øtes and has his vote in the tenets of the Papi≈øts, and that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ≈øeat of his Empire.</p>
