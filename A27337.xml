            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Am bound to you ſince a long time with ſuch particular Obligations, and my Duty ties me to you with ſuch strict Bands, that there is no Man in the World, beſides the own Brothers of my
<pb facs="tcp:59386:4"/>Dear Spouſe but I ought to prefer you before him. I have dedicated to them the two first. Books of the <hi>World Bewitch'd,</hi> and amongst all my Friends, whoſe Names I intend to prefix to each part of the <hi>French Tranſlation,</hi> I have made choice of you for this, that is, the first of all, and going to be publiſh'd. It's above thirty years ſince I have the Honour to be acquainted with you, and about fifteen, ſince I am allied to you by your Marriage with the Lady <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riette Fullenia,</hi> the nearest Couſin of my Spouſe, both from Father and Mother's ſide. It's likewiſe very near twenty years, ſince I was ſo happy as to ſee you a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the first College of the States of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> on whoſe direction the good or had ſucceſs of my Affairs depended at that time. When occaſion has offer'd it ſelf, I receiv'd from you Teſtimonies of a juſt favour and an ingenious diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Your Marriage tied more ſtrictly the Bands of the Friendſhip you had for me; and I have had the pleaſure to ſee it lasting to this day. You gave me late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an obliging proof of it, when you were pleas'd to preſent from me to his Highneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:4"/>Prince <hi>Henry Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Governor of our common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> my <hi>Frieſland's Divinity;</hi> which I had taken the liberty to dedicate to him. For I was not in a capacity of preſenting it my ſelf; becauſe the great Employments of his Hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſs calling him at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to different parts of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I could not be ſure ſo much as an hour of the place, where I might meet with him. This circumſtance procur'd me the Honour of receiving by the next Poſt a Letter from that Prince, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very expreſs Marks of his Affection; in which he alſo declar'd, that my Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had not been unpleaſant to him. But I have ſtill another reaſon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages me to preſent you with the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work, with which you ſeem'd very much pleas'd. It's your particular Concern in the Affairs of the Churches, in whoſe Tongue 'tis written, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in all thoſe of our Holy Religion: To this you inceſſantly apply your ſelf with a Zeal worthy of Imitation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, diſcharging ſtill in the <hi>Walloon</hi> Church of your City, the Honourable Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Elder, which you have formerly
<pb facs="tcp:59386:5"/>diſcharg'd many times; as well as in the Church of your Mother Tongue. Farther, I thought fit to cauſe this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to be Tranſlated my ſelf, leſt ſome others ſhould undertake it, having been advis'd, that the Tranſlation of it had been begun in this Town, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd elſewhere, without my knowledge; which however is happen'd, but ſince the late Synod of <hi>North-Holland;</hi> the proceedings that were made againſt me, having only been of uſe to excite the curioſity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as to this matter. And therefore I have prevented the deſigns of thoſe, who intended to make this Tranſlation, and provided at the ſame time, leſt any ſhould appear under my name, without my conſent, and my reviſing of it, as I may aſſert that I have done this. It comes from a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who has carefully apply'd himſelf to the ſtudy of our Tongue, and ſeems to me to underſtand his own ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. For tho' I am not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with it ſo far, as to have Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my own Book my ſelf: yet I think that I am able to judge, that I ſhould not have better ſucceeded, nor more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly have render'd my own Thoughts,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:5"/>if I had been in a capacity of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it. Beſides, this Tranſlation being almoſt verbal, becauſe the quality of the Work required it; It is ſo much the more difficult, and worthy that its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſhould be over-look'd. I think at leaſt, that no other difference will be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, betwixt it and the Original, but that of the Tongue; no real change having been made in it. I own that ſeveral matters of Fact have been added, and inſerted in divers places of this Book; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been left out, ſo that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall have no occaſion of complain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of his Loſſes; but rather of being glad of the new advantages that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him. I alſo have added after the Preface, an Abridgement of the whole Work, as a preliminary, that gives a general view and notion of it, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſubſtance, the Contents of the three laſt Books, that are to be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively Tranſlated; the ſecond being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy far advanc'd. I only earneſtly wiſh, that you may be as well ſatisfied with my Dedication, as I am with this Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that all that I have to do, is to commend you, and all your Friends and
<pb facs="tcp:59386:6"/>Relations, to the Grace of God, which I heartily beg of you all. But leſt any French Copy, of any of theſe Four Books, ſhould be publiſh'd under my name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe that are printed in this Townt for <hi>Peter Rotterdam,</hi> the firſt of which is dedicated to you; I declare that I own no other, but ſuch as are ſubſcribed by me, as this is, wherein I aſſure you with my own Hand, that I am,</p>

               <hi>A PREFACE, TO THE</hi> Whole WORK in General, <hi>AND THE</hi> Firſt Book in particular.</head>
            <p>IF ever any Author thought the Treatiſe he was publiſhing, needed an Introduction, methinks that I may not only have the ſame Opinion of this; but even that I cannot forbear it. Two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſons oblige me to it, one of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the circumſtances of what happened during the impreſſion of this work, and the other, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it's contents. Both theſe Reaſons has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, but the latter eſpecially appears ſtill more ſtrange, becauſe of the former; and therefore I intend to give the Reader ſome expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon both.</p>
            <p>Having form'd a deſign to write upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated of in this Book, I begun Eight Years ago in my Preface to the <hi>Book of Comets,</hi> to give ſome hints of what I intend to explain here more particularly. I had choſen for the ſubject of my publick Sermons, the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when I was come to the 11th v. of the 2 Chapter, in which the <hi>Magicians</hi> confeſs, they were not capable
<pb facs="tcp:59386:7"/>of expounding the King's Dreams; I drew from that Declaration, ſuch inferences, as evidently ſhow'd what muſt be believed concerning the extent of knowledge, aſcribed to the Devil; afterwards judging it convenient to examine his power, and whether it extends as far as is ordinarily ſaid; the firſt occaſion I had of aſcending the Pulpit, I took my Text on <hi>Exodus</hi> Chap. 8. v. 18th, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned why the Magicians could not as eaſily produce Lice, as Frogs and Serpents. The late <hi>Sieur de Tami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninga,</hi> Lord of <hi>Belleingweer,</hi> a learned and pious Gentleman, heard my Sermon, and lik'd it extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; thinking that if what I had propoſed, were printed, it would obtain the approbation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſons, and inform the ignorant. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted me himſelf ſeveral times to print that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and imployed other perſons to deſire me to do it; but I was ſo taken up with other buſineſs, as may be judged by the Books I have publiſhed, and by the aſſiſtance I have afforded my friends in the Edition of theirs, that I could not anſwer his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſoon, thô never abſolutely denyed to do it. Since that time, I preached twice again on the ſame matter, on occaſion of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> went to conſult, and of the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> who torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Job,</hi> many perſons preſs'd it hard upon me, to publiſh my Opinion on this ſubject. In 1689, as I was explaining in the Hoſpital Church, the 19th and following verſes of the 5th Chap. to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> I ſearched deeper into this matter, expounding the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> interpreters have tranſlated <hi>Poiſoning,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh, Witchcraft.</hi> But as I could not compriſe in a Sermon, whatever was to be ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I referr'd my hearers to a fuller inſtruction, in a larger volum that I was going to publiſh. I have given an account why it was not undertaken
<pb facs="tcp:59386:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>before, and now I ſhall inform the Reader, why it has been ſo long in the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Going from <hi>Francker</hi> to <hi>Loen,</hi> where I was call'd to be a Miniſter, I promiſed my Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller <hi>H. Nauta,</hi> that to keep our old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I would give him to print the firſt Treatiſe I ſhould compoſe in <hi>Holland;</hi> almoſt as ſoon as I was come thither, there appeared a Comet in the Years 1680, and 1681, which gave me occaſion to write a Book, Intituled, <hi>An Examination of Comets,</hi> which I put out in 1683. But as the Bookſeller deſired the Book might be ſomewhat larger, and I found it inconvenient to take care of a long impreſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea; I obliged him to continue it for that time; promiſing him, that, if he ever re-printed the ſame Treatiſe, I would either increaſe it; or add ſome other to it. I had no occaſion to keep to the firſt promiſe, no body having ſaid or written any thing againſt it, that required a more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. And therefore I thought fit to hold my Second promiſe, by adding to my <hi>Examination of Comets,</hi> another tract upon a matter ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, and on which I had meditated a long time. To that end, I compoſed an <hi>Examination of Magick,</hi> and Witchcraft, that contained very near as many ſheets as that of Comets; and I cauſed in Autumn laſt, a new Edition to be made of the latter, on purpoſe to joyn it to this new Treatiſe. But having ſometimes eſpecially in <hi>November</hi> 27th 1689, publickly confuted, in the Pulpit, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion; two days after, a Book was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me coming from <hi>England,</hi> where it was Printed, and Intituled, <hi>A Relation of the diſcovery of ſome Witchcrafts,</hi> in which very many particular things were ſaid to be contained. I thought by the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that it would quickly be tranſlated into our Tongue, to ſatisfy the curioſity of People. And
<pb facs="tcp:59386:8"/>as my Opinions are directly oppoſite to what is laid down in that Book, I perceived it might breed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt what I had ſo freely and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Pulpit, and ſuch as I ſhould ſcarce be able to deſtroy afterwards; becauſe of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtrength of the proofs brought forth in that work; for that Reaſon, I rather choſe to tranſlate it my ſelf, than to leave it to another, adding ſome remarks, fit to open the Eyes of the Reader, by diſcovering the grounds on which ſuch relations are laid; that he might not thereby be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed in the vulgar error; but that he might make uſe of theſe Annotations, until my compleat work concerning Magick and Witchcraft were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was to be, according to my expectation, in the following Months. But beſides the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of the Weather in Winter, and the diſtance of the place where it was printed, <hi>viz.</hi> beyond Sea, together with the Book of Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> for which the ſame preſs was imployed, cauſed a great deal of delay; during that time, I had leaſure to review my Treatiſe of Magick, and to increaſe it ſo, that it became much larger, than that of Comets; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the tranſlation and publiſhing of the Engliſh Book, procured me letters from ſeveral learned Men, and afforded matter to many Converſations, as well with thoſe that were of my Opinion, as with thoſe that were contrary to it. Thus having had occaſion to ſearch deeper into this ſubject, to give new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations of my Opinion, and to confirm them by new Reaſons; this works went on always increaſing, and the order and diſpoſition of it was ſo far chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that from a ſmall Book it became a bulky Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn. In the mean while, the impreſſion that was made at <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> ſeem'd to me, not only ſlow, but alſo very inconvenient, by Reaſon of the faults of the Preſs; of which I could not ſo well purge
<pb facs="tcp:59386:8"/>it, but that the firſt Book is ſtill full of them. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therefore to print the Second part at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Some time paſt, before that could ſucceed; however, without any inconveniency to the Book, for the Reaſons juſt now alledged. The cauſe of this ſlowneſs being unknown, ſome were not afraid to publiſh, that I had loſt courage, and durſt not attempt to enter the Liſts with the Devil: thoſe Rumours, the queſtions that were continually put to me, and the writings that were ſent me, when my Treatiſe was juſt coming out, obliged me to publiſh the two firſt Books, in which I mentioned ſomething of the two laſt, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſe the Reader. Beſides I hop'd, God would give me the Grace to make an end of the whole work, and to add what the Readers might think wanting or convenient. But it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the end of 1690, as I intended it, and the Bookſeller deſired it, for his own Intereſt; for the Froſt that came in on a ſudden, retarded the execution of it; it being not poſſible to ſend the Three laſt ſheets to <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> and to get from thence thoſe that were printed there, by reaſon of the Ice that put a ſtop to Navigation; ſo that I could have no Copy to preſent my friends with. I hoped ſtill however that it might be done, but the Froſt continuing, my Book thus imperfect was publiſht, and came without my knowledge, into the hands of many People in <hi>Friezeland.</hi> It was therefore only ſeen by piece-meal and without cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, which gave occaſion to ſome of the Readers, and others that had heard of it, publickly to paſs heard, judgments upon it; even ſome intended, as I am informed, to make me explain my ſelf more preciſely, had I not done it in the Book it ſelf. For at laſt, when they read it intire and in order, they all agreed, I had given all the explications that,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:9"/>could be wiſht, either as to the Reaſons that had moved me to write it; or as to to the ſcope I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to my ſelf, which appears in the Preface, and in the firſt Chapter of the Book; or as to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſefulneſs of its publiſhing, which I have ſhown in the ſame Chapter, and the laſt but one. They were juſt the places that were wanting, for which Reaſon I wrote to the Bookſeller of <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> and forbad him to give out any Copy of this Book, until the whole was compleat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, during the Froſt, I had time to add two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the end of the Second Book, and to enlarge the Preface, in order to inform the Reader of my Opinions, and the purity of my intentions, which has not proved altogether fruitleſs; for I have heard that moſt of thoſe, that have read the Preface and the work afterwards, have been ſatisfied, as they have told one another and my ſelf; whereas thoſe that had taken upon them to criticiſe it, had read but ſome looſe parcels of it, or had not read it at all, or perhaps had not ſo much as vouchſafed to read it.</p>
            <p>Things remained a while in that ſtate, every one enquiring after the Reaſon that hindered the publiſhing of my Book, and how it happened that I had none my ſelf, ſince it had been ſold in <hi>Frieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for ſome time. The Thaw came at laſt, and many Perſons arrived with News of the Edition of my Book, but brought no Copies along with them, ſave ſome privately, and as ſtolen goods; then every body wondered, a Book ſhould have been put out, in theſe Provinces, and it ſhould not be found in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Author lived; and not only my Brother Paſtors ſhould not have ſeen it, but I ſhould ſay, I had none my ſelf to preſent them with. At laſt I received 26 Copies of it from <hi>Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,</hi> but had ſcarce one for my ſelf; my friends came and took them away themſelves, as they were
<pb facs="tcp:59386:9"/>ſowed; and moſt of thoſe that ask'd for them, could not get 'em, unleſs they came juſt when they were ſow'd up. So greedy Men are of Novelties, eſpecially when they can hardly get 'em.</p>

            <p>However it be, the Book could not be expoſed to Sale before the 11th day of <hi>March.</hi> A long time after I had ſent the laſt Sheets to <hi>Leeuwarden,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> Bookſeller, who had had the Book per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his hands for a long time, A Bookſeller ask'd 50 Copies from him, and thought to receive them ſpeedily, but had none ſent to him. In the mean while, I find my ſelf much perplext. I was deſir'd, during two Months, by my beſt Friends, to communicate this Work to them, which they had never ſeen, and had heard commended; for this reaſon I wrote to Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> I would take all the Copies upon me; and pay them at ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rates, that he would be ſatisfied with it; he need but to ſend them to me without delay, with the firſt Veſſel. Then I thought to conſult with my Friends, whether I ſhould ſell the two Firſt Books, that had already appear'd imperfect in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and elſewhere, or whether I ſhould keep them until the whole Work was finiſhed. The firſt ſeem'd to be the beſt Advice, to avoid the ſuſpicion, that I durſt not publiſh my Book, or that I was forced to ſuppreſs it, becauſe of many things that were ſpread abroad to diſcredit it; however, the laſt counſel ſuited better with my inclinations. I conceived that a Work that was at firſt but a ſmal Treatiſe, thô it had ſince been much enlarged, would be more favourably received, and prove of greater uſe, if it were given compleat at the ſame time to the publick; that the deſign and cohering of it
<pb facs="tcp:59386:10"/>might be better ſeen, its Doctrines be more eaſily comprehended, and the happy effects it was able to produce be more plainly perceived, which is chiefly done by the laſt Part. But as the cauſes before alledged, had already once ſmother'd this deſign, ſo they did it again this time; for percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Letters of Mr. <hi>Nauta,</hi> it was impoſſible to agree with him, as to the price, and that it was unlikely he ſhould ever do it, I was at laſt forced to give up the Book to him, that I might (with the Bleſſing of God,) purſue my deſign. So having altogether broken with that Bookſeller, I have agreed ſome Months ſince, with another of this City, Mr. <hi>Daniel Vanden Dalen,</hi> to put divers Preſſes going upon it, and re-print the whole Work, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and corrected, that I might inceſſantly publiſh all the four Parts, one after another, in the form in wnich the Reader now ſees them. For as to the 750 Copies which Mr. <hi>Nauta</hi> had printed of the two Firſt Books, and are moſt of them ſtill upon his hands; they being an inconſiderble num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that could not go very far, and the haſty Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Book, being as yet imperfect, ſeem'd to give room to a new Edition, that the Pulick might be more ſpeedily ſatisfied. I therefore here preſent the Reader with the Firſt Book, enlarged with a new Chapter, that I thought neceſſary to add at the end. I hope, with the Bleſſing of God, that the three others ſhall ſucceſſively appear every Month; and I perſuade my ſelf, that the reading of the Firſt Parts, will excite ſome Curioſities for the later; and that altogether may invite the Reader to a ſerious conſideration upon the Contents, and capacitate him to judge more ſoundly of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he did, while this Treatiſe appear'd but in part, and confuſedly. This is what I had to ſay, as to this Edition, that was made in ſuch an
<pb facs="tcp:59386:10"/>extraordinary manner, and publiſh'd without my knowledge.</p>
            <p>I come now to treat of my ſcope, and what has obliged me to embrace the Opinions I aſſert in this Book. In all my Studies I was always inclin'd, not to reſt upon probabilities, but to ſearch into the whole matter, and to get a clear and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what I ſhould know. Beſides, many ſtrange things had happen'd to me in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> upon the firſt Writings I had publiſh'd, and experience had aſſured me, how little one ought to relye upon the Judgment of Men, eſpecially when what they are accuſtomed to teach, is call'd in queſtion. For is it not wonderful that my Book upon the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm ſhould have been unanimouſly condemn'd in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> thô amongſt above 200 Miniſters, who conſented to that Judgment, none could alledge ſo much as one ſolid Reaſon againſt it; and that afterwards it ſhould have been twice unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly approved of, without any change, as to the Doctrine and the controverted Points, having been made in it? This has confirm'd me in this perſuaſion, that a true Chriſtian, eſpecially a Doctor of Divinity, ought groundedly himſelf to enquire into things, without reſting upon the Judgment of others, that he may obtain a full certainty of the object of his Faith, and the matter of his Precepts. Since that time I reſolved only to follow the Holy Scripture, and Reaſon, in ſuch things in which it ought to ſupply the ſilence of the Sacred Writings, and to aſſure my ſelf by thoſe two means, of what I was to believe, and to teach others, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the trouble of following the ſteps of other Men; never putting Pen to Paper, but to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſubjects, the importance of which I was convinced of, or had not been ſufficiently explain'd and examin'd. I have therefore endeavour'd to
<pb facs="tcp:59386:11"/>free, as much as poſſible, our Holy Doctrine from ſuch errors, as moſt Men appear to me to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with; or at leaſt, to ſet in order, ſuch things whic I conceive to be confuſed; Whether I was the firſt that diſcover'd it, or whether I needed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to promote what had been begun by others. There are other Reaſons that have engag'd me in that deſign. For having ſworn in the Univerſity of <hi>Franeker, faithfully to maintain the pure Doctrine of the Reformed Church, and defend it both by words and writings, in all neceſſary occaſions;</hi> I may now ſay with <hi>Prudentius,</hi> and as it becomes my Age.</p>

            <p>But it would be too long to enter into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſhall only ſay that I intend to imploy the reſt of my Life; firſt, to the Duties and Functions of my Miniſtry, which the circumſtances and largeneſs of this Town make more painful than in other places; and than to make an exact enquiry after whatever is falſly believed in the World, and the Erroneous Opinions that are entertained without any other ground then that they are every day told and heard of. For my moſt earneſt deſire is, to ſee Men become more wiſe and honeſt than they are, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugh very few ſincerely intend it, or at leaſt do their Endeavours to attain to that perfection; moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art chooſing rather to believe, and to do, what is
<pb facs="tcp:59386:11"/>commonly believed and done, than to be at the trouble of freeing themſelves from Errors. In the mean while; what paſt in <hi>Freiſeland,</hi> when my firſt Book appear'd abroad, ought to have taught me, how dangerous it is to write upon ſuch matters; there being neither favour nor profit to be expected for ſuch Authors as rid themſelves from all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and having no regard, either for the Credit or Power of the Faction, whoſe Sentiments they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, reſolve to follow only what the Scripture teaches, or Reaſon dictates to them, and to embrace no Opinions, but ſuch as are founded upon thoſe two Grounds. Perhaps after my Death the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Undertaking will be known; and tho' I dare not hope that it will be done in my Life time; yet I publiſh it my ſelf, to learn the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publick, to defend my Works, and to enlarge or correct them, according to the Light I may acquire a-new, or that ſhall be communicated to me. For methinks, I am more able to do it, and to be Interpreter of my own Words and Thoughts, than thoſe that may afterwards adopt my Opinions, and have ſome regard for my Memory.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt, though my intention and ſcope may be plainly perceived by the firſt Chapter; yet I ſhall add, that no Men in the World are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any Atheiſtical Sentiments, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the Divinity of the Holy Writ, and more diſpoſed to render to God the Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to him, than thoſe, who as I am, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the common Opinion of the Power and Vertue of the Devil. Whoever ſhall read this Book with attention, and without partiality, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be perſuaded of it; at leaſt, I mean, that there is enough to ſatisfie thoſe that abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> concerning the uſe of Reaſon; and at the ſame time ſuch as give too
<pb facs="tcp:59386:12"/>much extent to thoſe Principles; and that thoſe two Parties will equally approve of the manner in which I diſtinguiſh Spirits from Bodies, and both from God, without however eſtabliſhing any thing as to their Operations that cannot be proved by plain and neceſſary Inferences. So that I powerfully confute the fooliſh Errors of <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> who confounds God and Nature together. I believe not that there is any Author, who has more ſolidly eſtabliſht the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difference that there is betwixt God and the Creature, and the inconſiſtency of the Properties of Bodies with thoſe of Spirits, then I do here; as was neceſſary to be done to lay a firm foundation to this work, that is wholly grounded upon that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, at leaſt as to thoſe things that are the object of the Light of Reaſon. Beſides, I have this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſatisfaction, that I confirm by an evident proof the Doctrine of our Churches, that tends ſtill to diminiſh the Honour paid to the Creatures, in order to increaſe that which is due to God. This Book witneſſes for me that I ſet up the Glory, Power, and Wiſdom of the Soveraign Maſter of the World, as much as they had been taken from him, to be communicated to the Devil. I baniſh from the Univerſe that abominable Creature to chain him in Hell, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our Supream King, may more powerfully and ſecurely reign. Though his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that is to endure to the laſt day, is likewiſe to ſubſiſt in the midſt of his Enemies, that are here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, that is amongſt the People of the Devil, or ſuch in whom Sin keeps ſtill imprinted the Image of the Devil. With that intention I am not afraid to explain in my ſecond Book ſeveral paſſages of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Writ in another Senſe, than they have hitherto been taken: But if by the publiſhing of ſuch new explications, one aimed not at the Honour of God, and only ſought to impair and ſtain the Reputation
<pb facs="tcp:59386:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>of thoſe that are of contrary Opinion, he ſhould take more to heart his own Credit than the Glory of God. As for me, who have formerly been in Opinions contrary to thoſe I ſpeak of, and which are ſtill held by the greateſt part of Men; I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly propoſe my preſent Sentiments, but only with a ſincere intention of glorifying God, and bringing Truth to Light. I think not therefore to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for not ſticking to the vulgar explications, I had formerly follow'd, and preferring before them thoſe of ſome Perſons, who have not done what I now ſuppoſe to be obliged to do. Yet I am not alone in theſe Opinions; for they are agreeable to thoſe of many others, ſome of whom have appear'd in the World even after me. And though they have produced and aſſerted in Writing thoſe new Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and Tranſlations of the Bible, but by way of Exerciſes, and to ſhew what ſubtilty and parts they acquir'd in their Youth, by the alteration of ſuch Expoſitions as had learned Men for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; yet as for me, methinks that in my old Age I ought to make uſe of my own Eyes, and to ſpeak with liberty. As for the reſt, if there are amongſt us, who, to multiply the proofs of our Opinion, and diminiſh thoſe of the contrary Party, ſtretch the Holy Scripture too far, that's their own fault, and not ours. We preſume to be provided with better Arms, to dcfend the Fundamental Truths of the Church. But it muſt be obſerv'd as a general fault, that the reading of the Bible is undertaken with a Mind full of its own prejudices, or thoſe of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and that 'tis generally explain'd according to thoſe Notions, without any other Reaſon or Ground but that of chance, or of ſome caſes that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the choice of ſuch parts as is then followed. I take the Vail from thoſe prejudices, and ſhew what Method is to be obſerv'd to undertake the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:59386:13"/>of the Holy Writ, without any prevention. For I hold it for certain, that none would have explain'd ſuch paſſages of the ſaid Writings as I here treat of, ſo as they are uſually Interpreted, had he not been imbu'd with a prejudice of the great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of the Devil, or had he not intended to confute ſome particular Errors. I have already proofs of it; for ſeveral learn'd and pious Perſons have very much approv'd of my Method of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Texts, and the ſearching into their Senſe; and having treated in my Sermons of the chief Points of this ſubject, I am inform'd that many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhew a great impatience to ſee my Writings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. I have frequently been in Converſations, where the moſt important matters, eſpecially thoſe that are contain'd in my ſecond and third Book, were diſcuſs'd, and they ſeem'd partly ſatisfi'd with my Explications, and in hopes of being fully convinc'd by thoſe they expected from me: I refer my ſelf to their Judgment, to know whether their expectation has been deceived or fulfill'd; being perſuaded that if they do not agree to ſome particulars, yet they will approve of my intention, and contribute their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that the greateſt part of the things I propoſe may be receiv'd and reliſh'd. If I were ſo caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to diſturb my ſelf on account of what may be ſaid and believ'd of my deſign, and to make more of the number than of the quality of the Readers, I ſhould undergo great hardſhips: For I doubt not but moſt Men, having little meditated upon this matter, will think that I commit a great Sin in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Treatiſe; not however in reference to the firſt Book, where I only relate the various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the ſeveral Nations from very credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, without declaring my own Sentiments, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing thoſe of others. Neither do I believe that the two laſt parts will be found fault with, but only
<pb facs="tcp:59386:13"/>the ſecond, where the moſt important Doctrines are diſcuſs'd, will raiſe ſome difficulty, and not pleaſe every one. It will eſpecially ſeem ſtrange, that I make ſo little account of the Devil, and endue him with ſuch an inconſiderable Power. For matters have been carried ſo far, that ſome Men think it a piece of Piety to aſcribe many Miraculous Effects to the Devil, and to hold for raſh and impious People thoſe that cannot believe, that he does what is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by thouſands of Witneſſes. If any contradict their Opinion, he is taken for an Atheiſt, that is, ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Exiſtence of one God, tho' he is only guilty of the Crime of not believing two, <hi>viz.</hi> a good and a bad. But thoſe that are of your Mind, deſerve themſelves to be called <hi>Ditheiſts,</hi> or ſuch as believe two Gods: [as the <hi>Arians</hi>] got the name of <hi>Tritheiſts,</hi> becauſe they believ'd three Gods [of different nature.] If any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to put a new name upon me, in reference to my Opinions, I willingly yield to that of <hi>Monotheiſts,</hi> that is, who believes but one God, and one Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> upon whoſe words I wholly truſt, where he ſays, <hi>Fear not them who kills the Body, but fear him who can deſtroy both Soul and Body,</hi> Mat. 10.28. I fear him much leſs, who has no power either over Body or Soul, and trouble not more my head with the judgments of thoſe Judg 6.13. <hi>In the name of the Lord the God of hoſts,</hi> I encounter that <hi>Goliah;</hi> let's ſee who will lend him a helping hand! It any think to have reaſons ſo ſtrong as to confute my Opinion, I deſire him to propound them, with as much ſoftneſs, as I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably diſpos'd to hear them; but at the ſame time I intreat him to ſpare to himſelf and to me, an unprofitable labour, and to wait till he have read the whole work, from the beginning to the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:14"/>end, before he makes his objections. By thoſe means he ſhall perfectly know whether thoſe particular and private places which he has read, and with which he had not been ſatisfyd, have afterwards been explain'd, and made worthier of his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the concatenation of the whole Treatiſe, and the reaſons contain'd in it: For it would be troubleſome to view and examine again, all the places of my Anſwers I would quote. So that it muſt not be take ill, if I give none to thoſe that ſhall follow another Method, and would make me waſte with them the time that can be better ſpent.</p>

It ſeeming to me it was convenient to inlarge a little more in that place; more exactly to ſhew the uſe and <hi>deſign</hi> of the ſearch I make in this Firſt Book, after the various opinions of all Nations, and better to diſcover the foundation of thoſe prejudices, that have ſo long kept us from examining the true ſtate of the matters contain'd in the following Parts.

               <hi>AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE Whole Work;</hi> What hath been the deſign of the Author, and what is his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</head>
            <p>AS the two firſt Books of this work that I publiſhed at firſt, have been differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for Reaſons alledg'd in the Preface; It will not be amiſs to repreſent to the Reader, what has been properly my deſign in theſe four Books, that I have Intituled, <hi>The World Bewitch'd,</hi> nor to ſhew what foundation I built upon, and what way I take to find out the truth. For althô I expreſs my ſelf clearly enough in the beginning of the work, and in the Preface to the firſt part; I know nevertheleſs, that is not ſufficient to deſtroy the prejudice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the learned themſelves appear more biaſſed than the Vulgar; which I ſhould never have thought; but it ſeems at preſent, I have found out the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:15"/>which is, that the moſt part of thoſe which do not put themſelves to the trouble to paſs through all the Degrees of the Schools, aſpire to Sciences and ſublime knowledge, but for their particular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; they are the People that love liberty, and to whom it matters not, who is the Maſter that inſtructs them, provided that they may learn ſomething; or if they are greedy of rarities, they have not ſo much reſpect to the mode, nor to that which is New or Antient, as to the beauty of the matter, and to that of the work. On the contrary, it is with thoſe who paſs through the Schools, as with thoſe who live in Shops, where every one has his way, every Maſter has his Method in the work he makes. In one Town they make the ſame things after one faſhion, and in another, after another; when one is taken up with the mode, he often rejects what is pleaſing, without any other Reaſon, then becauſe it is not as commonly uſed in the World. And we have a ſtrangeneſs for all novelties, ſo long as they have not the common vogue; althô otherwiſe, we might approve them, and have them cheap enough; but as ſoon as Cuſtom has introduced them, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſeek them out, and to be diſguſted at the former. Sciences are ſubject to the ſame inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. Thoſe that we ſend to the Schools, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the road which has been mark'd out to them for their exerciſes; they endeavour to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the model of thoſe which have moſt reputation, or of thoſe who are the neareſt to their firſt prejudices; ſo this is diſapproving the part they have taken, not to be apt to take any, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our own liberty, and thus we expoſe our ſelves very much; but one runs a greater risk, if will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſcend higher, and ſearch things in their Fountains, it happens at laſt, that we find our ſelves out of the ordinary Road, and that we are
<pb facs="tcp:59386:15"/>obliged to take another. <hi>Hinc illae lachymae, From thence proceeds all diſorders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The common Opinion of the Devil, of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, power, and Operations, and of People which are accuſed of having commerce with him, began by little and little to become very ſuſpitious by the help of natural light, which I have common with others, which was ſtrengthened and purified by the Scripture; ſo after I had well examined it, I was in doubt, whether I ought to maintain it any longer, or abandon it, not only by Reaſon of the truth, but alſo becauſe of the Piety which it ſeem'd to contradict: My Conſcience it ſelf compel'd me to it; for I was obliged to anſwer thoſe that ask'd me, and to take care of my Conduct, becauſe of the diſpoſition I ſaw the People in. It was the Duty of my charge, and every Day occaſions offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, my pain increaſed every moment, by the continual neceſſity I found my ſelf in, to ſpeak and act as others did, or to oppoſe the publick with words or actions, which agree not with my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which is to be complaiſant, and to agree with all the World, as much as is poſſible. Beſides I found not as yet foundation enough to act after an other manner, which made me at firſt reſolve to make an exact ſearch, after the Original of this common and general Opinion, to know whether it was founded upon truth. But becauſe I make this examination, <hi>à priore</hi> and not <hi>à poſteriore,</hi> as they in the Schools, I have propoſed the ſtate of the Queſtion, but at the end of the firſt Book; where I diſcovered in the 22th Chapter, how many of the Opinions, which I have related; (which are all thoſe that ever were in the World upon this ſubject,) The Proteſtants have at laſt got together, and formed thoſe which they retain to this Day. In the 23th Chapter I compare them with the Opinions

            <div type="part">
               <head>An Abridgement of the Firſt Book.</head>
               <p n="1">IN the Firſt Book I run over all the World, to find whence this Opinion has its Original. And for this purpoſe I have omitted neither time nor place. I obſerve that the ſubject ought to be examin'd in two Reſpects; In reſpect of the Devil, to find what is his Knowledge and Power; and in reſpect of Men, to ſee what they learn and effect by his means. But becauſe theſe things are preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, or are ſo thought to be, and that by conſequence they are known only to God, I have judg'd it neceſſary, to know what are the Opinions of Men concerning the Divinity, and Spirits in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, either good or bad, and of human Souls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Bodies by death, which are alſo Spirits: I make a ſearch of all theſe things, Firſt, in the Books of the Ancients, and afterwards in the Moderns of all Religions, and amongſt all Nations, diſtinguiſhing them into <hi>Pagans, Jews, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in reference to the preſent ſtate of the World. I begin with the Ancient <hi>Pagans,</hi> which are for the moſt part <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> known to us by <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Books they have leſt us: which I treat of in the 2d, 3d, and 4th Chapters; for there are very few Hiſtories of other Countries and other People, which are come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There you ſee what they believe touching Gods, and Spirits, which are neither Gods nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:59386:17"/>Souls; and as to the eſtate of the Souls after death: You read there alſo what means they uſed to attain that knowledge, and to operate things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Nature, by the means of thoſe Spirits, ſuch as they believe them to be. I come afterwards down to our time, and examine all the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the World; firſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the 6th, <hi>Chapter;</hi> after in <hi>Aſin,</hi> in the 7th and 8th <hi>Chapters;</hi> then in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the 9th <hi>Chapter</hi> and at laſt in <hi>America,</hi> in the 10th <hi>Chapter;</hi> which gives me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to demonſtrate in the 11th <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as well Ancient as Modern, have had a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divinity, that is all powerful, but that they have aſſociated to him, inferior Gods. That the Greeks have often called them Demons, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Gods, as moſt of the Pagans do at this Day; which Demons, or inferior Gods, have every one their ſhare in the Adminiſtration of the Univerſe, directing the affairs of Men under the name and Authority of the Soveraign God, and being as Mediators between him and Men: They converſe alſo with theſe laſt, who can, by their means, know and effect things above the power of Nature. This knowledge gives ſome the name of Diviners, and theſe Operations cauſe others to be called Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Sorcerers; in conſequence of which, all the effects that we cannot give a Reaſon for, or find the cauſe of, are attributed to theſe Demons or inferior Gods,</p>
               <p>The Souls of the Dead are alſo ranked amongſt the Demons, and according as they have behav'd themſelves well or ill upon Earth, the good or evil which happens to Men, is attributed to one or the other. It is that which has given occaſion to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the inferior Gods, into good and bad.</p>
               <p>After the Pagans, which know neither the true God nor Religion; I treat of thoſe which have the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:59386:18"/>Scripture among them, of whom the firſt are the Jews, having known God a long time before all the others, and received his Word in the writings of the Old Teſtament, where they have learned, that in truth the Souls of Men are immortal, but that there are no Demons, or inferior Gods, ſuch as the Pagans fancy. That God alone by himſelf rules the Univerſe, and that none can have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or produce effects beyond the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that belongs to God only. I obſerve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Judaiſm in the ſtate into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly fallen, ſince the coming of Chriſt, and as it is at this Day, is very much mixed with Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, or at leaſt very much infected with it; whence proceeds the practices of Divinations and Sorcery, that are in faſhion amongſt the Jews, <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the 13th.</p>
               <p>After that I repreſent, that the Mahometans who acknowledge but one God, and created Angels good and bad, and the Devil as chief of them. That the Mahometans, I ſay, who have admitted the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and reverence Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as a great Prophet, have nevertheleſs mixed in all their Opinions, a great many of thoſe of the Pagans, which they have for the moſt part received, and that they are no leſs inclined to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations and Witchcraft, <hi>Chapter</hi> the 14th.</p>
               <p>After the Jews and the Mahometans, who keep a kind of mean between the Pagans and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; I paſs to theſe laſt, and diſtinguiſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time, before Popery, under Popery, and ſince Popery. By this means I ſhow, that the primitive Chriſtians ſince the Apoſtles, have inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly introduced amongſt them, many Opinions of Paganiſm and Judaiſm, which have been increaſing under Popery till they attained to the heigheſt pitch, and that they had aſcribed to the Angels, the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Souls of the deceaſed, eſpecially to the Devil, all the Miracles which the Pagans attributed to the Demons, the Devils, and inferior Gods, <hi>Chapter</hi> the 15th to the 21.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, I take notice, that among the Ancient Chriſtians, there aroſe a Sect called the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which had admitted in particular a great many Pagan Opinions, and made the Devil almoſt equal to God. And I ſhow, that their Opinions have inſenſibly been propagated, in Chriſtianity, even to our times; after that I come to theſe laſt Ages, and to the Doctrines of the Proteſtant Churches, among which I rank all thoſe that are Call'd <hi>The Reformed,</hi> that is, all thoſe that are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Popery; upon which I remark, that the more we are remote from Paganiſm, either for time or place, there's the leſs credit given to all thoſe things which reſpect the Devil and his Power. Nevertheleſs I ſhow, that part of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not having comprehended enough, what are the foundations of the Proteſtant Doctrine, nor in what it differs from Popery, are taken with the common Opinion of Devils, to whom as well as to Men, that have Communication with him, they attribute more eaſily ſo many marvelous effects, and ſo much above the power of nature, then others do, who have more meditated and reflected upon thoſe Doctrines and variations. <hi>Chapter</hi> the 22th and 23.</p>
               <p>Laſtly having compared all theſe Opinions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I conclude that the common Opinion which has been in requeſt amongſt us to this day, had it's Original from Paganiſm, not that the meer uſe of Reaſon ſhould produce ſuch thoughts, but on the contrary, the ill uſe that is made of it. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſuffer our ſelves to be ſeduced, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a falſe appearance of Piety, without having recourſe to the light of the Scripture, that we fall
<pb facs="tcp:59386:19"/>into ſuch Extravagancies, with which we are pleaſed, and love to continue in them. I prove that theſe are thoughts that never were inſpired to the Chriſtians by the Holy Scripture, by reaſon that thoſe who read it leſs, and underſtand it leſs, give more Credit to theſe ſort of things, and becauſe all the World is already prevented before they read it, and meditate upon it.</p>
               <p>For by theſe Reaſons I endeavour to bring the Reader to conſider, whether the Scripture gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to believe all thoſe things that are ordinarily ſaid upon that ſubject, or to believe them ſo as they are ſaid; or whether ſuch Sentiments have not taken root in us from our tender Youth, and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Cuſtom. At beſt, I have a very ſtrong preſumption for that Reaſoning, that when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before-hand, that ſuch a thing is, there is a great diſpoſition to turn our Reaſon, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Scripture to that ſide, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the inclination we have of it comes from Reaſon, and even the Holy Writ leading us thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Moreover, we receive the firſt Interpretations, and the Commentaries upon the Scripture, from the hands of thoſe antient Doctors, touching which I prove, Chap. 15. that they have been all prejudiced, ſome more, others leſs, in favour of many Pagan Doctrines and Opinions, which have unawares given occaſion to that Senſe in which the Scripture has been expounded by them. Theſe are the Contents of the 24th Chapters, and the concluſion of the firſt Book.</p>

               <p>In ſeems to me that for all theſe Reaſons it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to conceive, that this firſt part of my Treatiſe is not ſo unprofitable as ſome imagine. They will
<pb facs="tcp:59386:19"/>that regard be had only to the ſecond Book, and that the firſt ſhould not be inſiſted upon, becauſe it conſiſts but in Hiſtorical narrations, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing. But as far as I am capable to give a reaſon for the ſtructure of my own building; I ſay the Second Book is founded upon the Firſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proofs I am perſwaded I have law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn by good conſequences, <hi>Chapter</hi> 14. For if it were otherwiſe, I had reaſon to be ſurprized; that of ſo many, who exclaim againſt my Second Book, paſſing my Firſt, none has taken notice of my error in this point, and declared it to me, very few ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſo much as reflected upon it. But in vain they attack the Second, if they admit the Firſt. They in no wiſe ſee the end I aim at, nor the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I have followed, as ought to be done, in an exact ſearch after the Truth. But they undertake to confute my Second Book, becauſe it offers a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger field to their cenſures, by different things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in an oppoſite Senſe to that of the literal; like thoſe ignorant Diſputants, who let ſlip the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Propoſitions, and deny the conſequence that is neceſſarily drawn from it. I have reaſon to complain for paſſing an over-haſty judgment upon the halfe of my Work, without ſtaying till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared intire, and they have ſeen the following Part, and the Connexion; no circumſtance of time required that precipitation, for I had not loſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to publiſh the two laſt Parts, had they not hinder'd it by the diſturbances they have given me. I believe not that the whole extent of a project, or its oeconomy, may be perfectly ſeen, while 'tis but halfe done. So 'tis but at preſent that ſome judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be paſt upon this work, ſince it begins but now to appear altogether, and to be a perfect Body with all its Members.</p>

I examine in the Second Book, what concerns Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and in the Third, what concerns theſe wicked People, who ſeek to deal with them, according to the diviſion that I have propoſed in the beginning of the Firſt Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. As to the Fourth, I ſhall ſay hereafter, what connection it has with the former, and its uſefulneſs.</p>
               <p>Touching the method I take, to make, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and in order, this <hi>Search after Truth;</hi> if what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have written upon this ſubject, be attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd, you will undoubtedly know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of thoſe who impute to me, that I offer chiefly new Propoſitions of my own head; that I take the greateſt trouble imaginable to wreſt the Scripture, and my reaſonings to accommodate them to it; or that I make uſe of Reaſon, as of a Rule with which I would meaſure Scripture, and adapt it to the ſame. On the contrary, it is impoſſible not to ſee, that I never had as yet the leaſt thought of building upon ſuch a foundation; but that I have run through all the World, and all times, to diſcover where Men may have found the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Opinions, which I have undertaken to find out. For when one has attain'd to that knowledge, he is in a condition to judge ſolidly, whether thoſe Opinions or Practices are grounded upon good or bad Reaſons. I declare then, that I have not examined all the divers Opinions of the <hi>Pagans, Jews, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well Ancient as Modern, nor their Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with an intent to give explanations of them, nor to main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So far I lay no foundation. I that am a Chriſtian and a Proteſtant, and have no deſire to become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſt, Jew, or Pagan. If I found nothing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in the ſearch I make, I conſent that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to ſay and believe concerning Spirits in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Devils in particular, all that is wont to be ſaid, and all that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>But altho', I have not as yet found the bottom I ſeek, and that neither Popery, Judaiſm, nor Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm conſidered in themſelves, having there withal to furniſh me, I have notwithſtanding a ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which is common to me with thoſe People: And I have further another particular, which I have in common but with part of them. The firſt is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is the light of all men in general, when it is found pure in them, and neither perplexed, nor obſcured by prejudices or paſſions. The other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which I reſt, is, the Scripture inſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, which is equally pure in it ſelf; And and to the reading of which we ought alſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves, as if one had never read them; that is to ſay, with an entire diſingagement of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prejudices; and from thoſe that may proceed from the verſions of the Hebrew and the Greek, which are the original languages in which it has been written; he muſt meditate upon it, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard to the interpretation which have been made by all ſorts of Doctors, either Ancient or Modern.</p>
               <p>Theſe two foundations are not Subordinate one to the other, but ſubſiſt equally together. <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, loving very much to ſearch allegorical Senſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This application is become ſo familiar to Divines, that it has been received as an undeniable maxime, ſince <hi>Philo</hi> took a fancy to propoſe it.</p>
               <p>It is however a truth, that reaſon ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Scripture, becauſe the latter preſuppoſes the former; I underſtand ſound reaſon, to which the Scripture ought to preſent it ſelf, and make it ſelf known as divine; after that, Reaſon comes to the help of Scripture, teaching us things wherein Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent, and the Scripture likewiſe comes to aſſiſt reaſon, diſcovering to us things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, and above the reach of our underſtanding. We muſt nevertheleſs confeſs, that the Scripture is above reaſon, not as miſtreſs, for they have every one their particular Empire and Direction: But as being more noble and excellent; becauſe it is in this God manifeſts to us, things which no humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ever could comprehend, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2.9. notwithſtanding it happens ſometimes that they meet both in the ſame way, where they lodge together in the ſame houſe, and by conſequence they often lend one another the helping hand, but they do it freely, althô with this difference, that reaſon as an inferiour, alwayes ſhows a great reſpect for the Holy writ.

<pb facs="tcp:59386:21"/>things which are above our reach, which are only manifeſted to us in the word of God; and which we are obliged to believe as Scripture diſcovers them, althô we comprehend them not. But it does not follow from thence, that we ought to believe thoſe things, ſuch as men teach us by their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or even by their tranſlations, without a great certainty that they are faithful. So then the word of God conſidered as it is originally, and in it ſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God without any reſpect to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations that have been made by men; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not ſuch as is born with us, and when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd with prejudices, and blinded with paſſions, but reaſon purified by the ſame Spirit which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the Scriptures; the Scripture I ſay and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are the two only lawful and true grounds of the knowledge we can acquire, as well in things Natural as Spiritual.</p>
               <p>But there is yet another diſtinction to be made upon this Subject, that is, that reaſon is the ground and rule of our knowledge in natural things, ſince the Holy writ never treats of them purpoſely to inſtruct us, and diſcover them to us, and that it ſpeaks of them only as of ſubjects; the nature of which is known to us as much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make a good uſe of them, as well in civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as in Spiritual. In what concerns our Salvation, the word of God is the only ground of our Faith, and the rule of our Life without being in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our reaſon, to add, to take from, or to change any thing in it, thô it ought to be employed on this occaſion, in two manners; the firſt is to try the Scriptures that are ſaid to be divine, in making uſe of the knowledge that Men have naturally of God, to know whether the Scriptures preſent to them, ſuch Characters of truth as are agreeable to that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond is, to comprehend by the ſenſe
<pb facs="tcp:59386:22"/>of the word contained in them, the doctrines there propoſed for our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Further we muſt be perſuaded, that Scripture and Reaſon are mutually helping, to one another, in ſuch matters as are of their Juriſdiction; for if the Scripture ſpeaks not ſometimes naturally of things naural; Nevertheleſs as it never propoſes any thing falſe, tis the part of reaſon to inſtructus, after what n anner the Holywrit muſt be underſtood in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according as the matter required; as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. touching the deſcription of the courſe of the Sun, and in many other like places. Or if there be any thing in nature, that our proper experience has not ſufficiently diſcover'd to us to paſs a ſafe Judgment, and that we be obliged to rely upon the Credit of others, who perhaps are not much more knowing than ourſelves: The Scripture may alſo in this occaſion afford us ſome light; As in what is ſaid of the Rain, <hi>In the Evening and the Morning in Judea, Jeremiah</hi> 6.24. the little rain that falls in that Country in the time of Harveſt, and the few ſtorms that are ſeen there, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17. of the violence of the Eaſt wind upon the coaſt of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in the Medite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 48.8. and the like. But that which is moſt conſiderable is, that the Scripture it ſelf inſtructs us of ſome certain natural things, to which the reach of reaſon ſhould never attain, they are ſo much above it. Such is the beginning of the World, eſpecially that of Man, by the immediate creation of God out of nothing. And ſuch is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the darkneſs and corruption in which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding is plunged, as they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the help of ſuch ſound and pure remained light, as is in them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the general Principles I preſuppoſe, which I believe to be ſuch, that there is no Body, in what particular Senſe he may be, that will conteſt
<pb facs="tcp:59386:22"/>them. Upon which I come to examine what is true in all the relations I have faithfully made in my firſt Book, and which are the Sentiments, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſcourſes of all Men upon that ſubject. But it is manifeſt, that I have not made to my ſelf any particular Principles; and much leſs put Reaſon and Philoſophy above Scripture: Even the contrary will be ſeen as clear as the Noon-Day, if you take the trouble to read my Writings with attention, and without Prejudice: For I obſerve as to this reſpect, as well as in reference to Comets, (in which Treatiſe I have followed the ſame order, of which I am amaſed it has not been perceived) the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ought to be diſcuſs'd of one ſide with relation to Nature, and on the other with reference to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ; and therefore I begin with Reaſon, which is inferiour to the two others, to ſearch into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in the loweſt School, what it teaches moſt pure touching God and Spirits, and particularly the Devil. For ſince the Pagans have preſumed to ſay ſo many things of the Demons, that they had not learned of the Scripture, of which they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it ſeems to me that I am not in the wrong to examine what there was that was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reaſon; and of what Opinions it ſeems to be the principle, or what are thoſe that are derived from another ſourſe. But as what I could diſcover by the deepeſt and moſt exact ſearch I could make in that loweſt School, is yet but inconſiderable; I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend a degree higher, where I find a Miſtreſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to this firſt, that is, the Scripture, that I begin to conſult in the 8th Chapter of the ſecond part. Now as in the ſeven firſt Chapters, where I walk as in Nature alone, I lay aſide Scripture to try how far human Underſtanding may attain by its own ſtrength; ſo I leave reaſon behind, as ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:59386:23"/>as I enter into the Sanctuary of the Word of God, whoſe Oracles are infallible.</p>

                  </gap> not as a foundation, or as a rule by which I may expound the Scripture; But I exclude it not as a means, by which I acquire the underſtanding of the Scripture; for on the contrary I cannot want it in this reſpect, were it not for my Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in relation to God, I ſhould be in the ſame rank with Beaſts; but it is not to Beaſts that God ſpeaks, but to Men, that is, to rational Creatures. Reaſon may act alone without Scripture, in things that are of its Juriſdiction, for Arts and Sciences are the objects of Reaſon: From thence they proceed, and thereby they are learned, that is, Man uſes his own light for that purpoſe, without having recourſe to the inſtructions of the Word of God, and without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion for them. But for the things of an higher Nature, which concern the Will of God, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Salvation of Man, the Scripture is the true principle and ſolid foundation upon which our truſt is founded; although Reaſon ought to concur with it, to underſtand and comprehend under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Spirit of God, the Senſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So in this ſecond examination of the ſecond part, where the certainty of the knowledge which proceeds from Scripture alone is treated of, I am nevertheleſs obliged to employ my Reaſon, to the end it may ſerve me to examine what Scripture contains; not that it may reach ſo far as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the things themſelves; but it ought nevertheleſs to comprehend what the Scripture it ſelf ſays, and that things are ſuch as it ſays, although I conceive them not ſuch as they are.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:23"/>
               <p>But ſee here the knot of the difficulty, that is that every one crys out, that the Scripture ſays ſuch or ſuch things, becauſe he conceives that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays them, and when the Scripture may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ys, we eaſily embrace the Senſe which beſt ſuites our Notions. If already, without too much examination, we have ſufferd our ſelves to be prejudiced with Opinions, of which we would however be better ſatisfied, and find ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtruction in the Scripture; It is not ſought with that impartiality and liberty of Mind which are neceſſary; but we ſtill incline towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. If there is the leaſt appearance that we may, by wreſting the Scripture, adapt it to the Senſe we would have it, we never fail to do all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in order thereto, and afterwards imagine to have found there ſufficient proofs in favour of our Opinion, becauſe it ſeems to ſay what we deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As we ſee two Counſellors explain the ſame Law, each for the advantage of his Client; and that they never want Reaſons on both ſides to confute the contrary Arguments; ſo that they appear each to have the right on his ſide; and that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to extricate what they have ſo much perplexed.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, that I my ſelf do what I condemn in others; and for me, I maintain that thoſe, who are conſcious of their guilt and worthy of cenſure, caſt that imputation upon me, ſeeing me explain ſo many paſſages in another Senſe than that with which they are prevented, without any other Reaſon than becauſe it is ordinarily received. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that this change proceeds in me from the ſame cauſe that I diſcover in them. See the true cauſe that makes them ſay I wreſt the Scripture; not that I really wreſt it, but rather that I keep not as a Slave to their Interpretations. But I make, ſay they, a falſe Suppoſition, and after I endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:24"/>to give to the Scripture a Senſe which agrees to that Suppoſition; That may be, but to know what it is, you muſt examine after what manner I make the expoſition of the Scripture; and whether I turn it towards my prejudices; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efore 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I explain a little more clearly every one of the Articles I treat of.</p>
               <p>The Principle, they ſay, I ſuppoſe is, that a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot act upon a Body, nor upon other imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirits. That's the burthen of the Song, and what they make me ſay over and over every where, and is ſo confidently publiſhed, that even my Friends can ſcarce forbear crediting it; as there come every day occaſions, which make me know it. It is a prejudice that paſſes from hand to hand from one party to another: It inſenſibly ſpreads it ſelf in all the Minds, and in that Diſpoſition the reading of my Book is undertaken: but they ſeldom read it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, from one end to the other, as it would be but juſt and neceſſary to do; they only read ſome ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate places, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe they are referr'd to, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe in which I diſpute upon the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Spirits: For I may boldly ſay, that of thoſe that have read my Book with attention, I find but very few which hold the ſame Diſcourſes: On the contrary, they take quite another party, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Truth. So that I defie all thoſe that have read it, to mark ſo much as one place where I put as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of my Opinion touching the Devil, <hi>That a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot act either upon a Body, or another Spirit.</hi> What is then the foundation of this noiſe, which is ſo ſtrongly and ſo generally ſpread abroad, and which is the cauſe of the great proſecution that is made againſt me? It is this general prejudice which proceeds from the common Expoſition of the paſſages of Scripture upon this; that is, <hi>That a Spirit, as a Spirit, and ſo much the more as it is a Spirit, can
<pb facs="tcp:59386:24"/>without Body act upon all ſorts of Bodies, and upon other Spirits.</hi> I require proofs of this Theſis; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this demand is unthought of and extraordinary, and upon which by conſequence every one is not prepared, my demand is taken for a Negative. But before I lay my ſelf that foundation, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is not call'd in Queſtion, I examine firſt the Grounds upon which theſe People themſelves reſt their Opinion, or upon what they ought to eſtabliſh it, according to the Idea they have of Spirits; I ſay, according to the Idea they have of Spirits; for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> they diſtinguiſh them from Bodies the more neatly then other Philoſophers do, or that they groſly attribute ſomething corporeal to them. Theſe two Idea's nevertheleſs proceed as yet equally, from that they conceive the Operations of Spirits upon external Objects, whether Bodies, or other Spirits, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Spiritual Nature; and from that they include them in the notion they have of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and it is by this means, that inſtead of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Body as an inſtrument which is neceſſary to the Operation of Spirits, or at leaſt proper to them, they look upon it as an obſtacle to the liberty and virtue of the Operations of a Spiritual Nature, Thence comes that every Body crys <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <head>An Abridgment of the Second Book.</head>
               <p>As to what concerns my Second Book ſee the method I have taken. I begin with the diſtinction of names, in fixing at firſt, what muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a Body, and a Spirit, to avoid all equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: which I have done in the firſt Chapter. I ſpeak of God in the Second, proveing not only, that the ſupream Being which I denote by that word, is only one, but alſo that there is not the leaſt communion between it and created things; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly confuting the Opinion of <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> upon this ſubject; which I pretend to do with more force and evidence than any hitherto, becauſe ordinarily they undertake to demonſtrate by the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and incomprehenſible Eſſence of God, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and virtue of the Operations of created Spirits, which I abſolutely reject, as a way which is uſed to lead us into error. By conſequence I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the arguments which are taken from the nature of God, to demonſtrate in what manner acts a Spirit which is his creature, and has nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with him, but the name. After, in the Third Chapter, I prove by arguments drawn from the ſovereign perfection of God, that there are none of thoſe ſorts of Spirits, that the Pagans eſteem to be Gods and ediators of Men towards the ſupream Divinity; becauſe the Reaſons of thoſe that ground that belief upon the perfection of God, are directly oppoſite to this perfection.</p>
               <p>We then having taken off the imaginary Spirits, I come to thoſe which we certainly know to exiſt; that is, our Souls that are a part of our ſelves, and which by conſequence, are better known to us by
<pb facs="tcp:59386:25"/>our own experience; this is treated of in the fourth Chapter, where I prove as much as is poſſible their immortality, and that they ſubſiſt even out of the body: I employ for this purpoſe, Reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe they are two ways, that equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to the knowledge of the Soul; the firſt by experience and by our own Conſciouſneſs; and the ſecond by the particular inſtructions God gives us of the eſtate of the Soul, after this life: but I quote not the Scripture in this part of my Treatiſe, where I examine but what concerns nature only. Neither do I judge it neceſſary to do it afterwards, becauſe it is a point that a Chriſtian looks upon, as already ſufficiently eſtabliſhed; and ſuppoſes it when he will engage in a diſpute upon this ſubject. Beſides, I reject as ſuperſtitions and fables, whatever, proceeds from the invention of Men, eſpecially of the Heathens, which is the matter of the fifth Chapter. So we come to know with certainty, that ſuch a Spirit, that is the Soul which truly exiſts, has a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with which it lives, and without which it may ſtill live, and to reject all the other Spirits, of whom the greateſt part of the World falſly believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. But beſides thoſe Pagan Opinions, we hear every day mention made of Angels, not only by Chriſtians, but alſo by Jews and Mahometans. The Queſtion is, Whether Reaſon alone is capable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, that there are ſuch Spirits, deſtitute of a proper and peculiar body? Upon this point I ſhew in the ſixth Chapter, that our underſtanding without the help of Scripture, cannot penetrate far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to comprehend, that it is poſſible, but not certain, that there are Spirits. For this Reaſon, I have not judg'd it neceſſary, to examine the Operations of theſe Spirits upon bodies, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other Spirits; becauſe it ſeems to me ridiculous to trouble ones ſelf with the examination of the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:26"/>Operations of Creatures, the exiſtence of which is not eſtabliſhed as certain. And therefore I have ſpoken in the firſt Edition, but by the way in verſe, which is at preſent, the ſeventh Sect. of the ſixth Chapter. And therefore it is manifeſt how wrongfully many People would perſwade themſelves, that I have compoſed my work only, <hi>To deny the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirits upon bodies, and upon other Spirits.</hi> And beſides, that I ground upon this negative, all my explications of the paſſages of Scripture; but that I may avoid this perſecution for the future, I thought fit to inſert in the new Edition that is made of my Book, a whole Chapter between the ſixth and ſeventh, ſo that this new Chapter is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſeventh, and the ſeventh is the eight, and ſo of the others following. There I pretend clearly to ſhew, that the proofs related upon that ſubject, ſtrike not at all to the end, and cannot be conſidered as true proofs; which I mean as to what concerns nature, and as to what Human Reaſon may conceive of it ſelf, as deſtitute of help from the word of God.</p>
               <p>After that I come to the word of God, and then I employ Reaſon no more, but keep to the Scripture only and I ſearch in it, what it will teach me, touching Spirits, which is now the queſtion; there I find that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Angels, it gives us to underſtand, ſuch Spirits as are the Miniſters of God, toward other Creatures. But there is nothing diſcovered to us, touching their Eſſence; neither is their any thing in the Hiſtory of the Creation, as to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, or the manner of their fall; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, part of them was from the beginning rejected from God; notwithſtanding, the Scripture puts theſe two things for certain, which is the ſubject of the eight and ninth Chapters.</p>
               <p>I conſider afterwards the properties and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Scripture attributes to them, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:26"/>to know, what is their proper nature, their power upon other Creatures, either ſpiritual or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. But the paſſages that ſpeak of theſe things do not appear to me to have been underſtood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than thoſe that attribute alſo to certain Men, that is, to Prophets and Apoſtles, the works that they have done in diſpenſing the miracles of God. That which gives me occaſion to ſay, that as this diſpenſation ſurpaſſes the force of thoſe to whom it was entruſted, it cannot make us know what was their proper nature, whence I take occaſion to infer the ſame things touching Angels; this is in the tenth and eleventh Chapters.</p>
               <p>That which could not be diſcovered by the means of the name, Original, or Operation of thoſe Spirits, I endeavour to learn by the means of their orders, of which is made an ample men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the twelfth, fifteenth, and nineteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my firſt Book. But I draw not any light from thence, ſave that Angels, as well good as bad, have each their head; that the Prince of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is called <hi>Michael,</hi> and that of the bad, named <hi>Diabolus,</hi> the Devil; that is in the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Yet I leave it not here; I conſider again, that the Scripture attributes in many places, ſome particular adminiſtration to Angels, I examined to know what it is, firſt as to the good Angels in general, in the thirteenth Chapter, whom the Scripture often makes appear, and always for particular revelations to the faithful, either to work extraordinary miracles, or execute God's Judgments upon Men by puniſhments, or by deliverances. But I conceive not that what is ſaid of this Miniſtry, is different from what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of that of thoſe holy Men, who have been employed in the works of God and his miracles, that they in no wiſe operated by their own virtue;
<pb facs="tcp:59386:27"/>by conſequence I find nothing as yet which may give me a certain knowledge of the proper Angels, their power, or their Operations.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I come to a more particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the principle paſſages, eſpecially of the manner of ſpeaking of theſe three perſons, which appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the two others that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Lot, Geneſis,</hi> Chapter the eighteenth and nineteenth: and in making reflection upon this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and comparing it with other inſtructions of the Holy Scriptures; It ſeems to me, that I am in the right to conclude, that thoſe Angels, that is to ſay, thoſe Meſſengers, were Men as they named themſelves; not being able in the mean while, to determine what muſt be underſtood by the Angel of the Face of God, which conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſert, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23 <hi>Chap.</hi> and by the Angels, by whom God gave his Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> I propoſe only my thoughts, and what ſeems to me may be underſtood by it, by a Collation of the paſſages of the Holy writ, which make mention of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that Divine conduct of the Iſraelites, in the deſert, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>I paſs farther and examine what is ſaid in the Scripture concerning the Angels, with relation to ſome certain Perſons, Nations, and Countries: And I conclude from thence, that what has ever been variouſly written upon this ſubject by particular Authors, is not founded upon Scripture, becauſe all the paſſages made uſe of to ground thoſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpeak but figuratively.</p>
               <p>At laſt coming to the Devil, and to the reſt of evil Angels, I ſee that this name has been given as well to ill Men, as to evil Spirits, and even firſt to wicked Men. So I examine in the 17, 18 and 19 <hi>Chapters,</hi> what may moſt conveniently be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the <hi>Chief of evil Spirits;</hi> but in making
<pb facs="tcp:59386:27"/>the examination of all the particular paſſages which are uſually applied to the Devil, I find that the name of <hi>Satan</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> is uſed in ſome of theſe paſſages, and that of <hi>Daemon</hi> and of <hi>Daemonium</hi> in ſome others. And that there are ſeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ordinarily applied to the Devil, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to double my cares, that I may diſcover what ought to be underſtood by <hi>Devil,</hi> eſpecially in the Hiſtory of the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in that of the temptation of the ſecond. This is the matter of the 20 and the 21ſt, <hi>Chapters.</hi> The other paſſages which contain the name of <hi>Satan,</hi> appear to me to be different from theſe, of which I treat in the 23, 24 and 25 <hi>Chapters.</hi> I examine after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the 26 to the 30, what are the <hi>Daemonia,</hi> and thoſe that are called <hi>Poſſeſt.</hi> And laſtly, in the 31ſt, <hi>Chapter,</hi> what muſt be underſtood in all the other paſſages, where inſtead of the name of <hi>Devil,</hi> and of <hi>Demons,</hi> others quite different are uſed.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the principal operations attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Devil in Scripture, conſiſt in the fall of the Firſt Man, and the aſſaults he made upon our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Deſart; Thence I take occaſion to examine, Whether thoſe Accounts may ſerve to the Opinion of the power of this evil Spirit, and of the power of his operation upon Men? But it ſeems to me, that in the narration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fall of Man, that happen'd by the diſcourſe of a Serpent, nothing is ſaid that ought to carry me to conclude, that the Devil himſelf can act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Soul and Body of Man. Here I keep to that diſcovery, without going any further. Thoſe that are of another Opinion, find that this concluſion is drawn from that Relation, with a full evidence, and aske how the fall of Man could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwiſe; rendring themſelves guilty of the ſame fault they reproach me with, by pretending
<pb facs="tcp:59386:28"/>to know themſelves, how the thing came to paſs, and to be able to render the reaſon of it. But he that judges, ought not to ſpeak of it ſo poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declaring he knows nothing of it, and finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing revealed upon that point, he is preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of denying the ſame thing it ſelf, and of not believing the matter of Fact, becauſe he grants he is not acquainted with the manner of it. The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Voetius</hi> has however, explained himſelf upon this ſubject very near, as I do, for in the <hi>firſt part of his Diſputes, pag.</hi> 915. ſpeaking of the fall of Man, he ſays, <hi>upon the Queſtion, to know how, and in what manner? it is not poſſible to give ſo ſatisfactory an anſwer; but it may be ſeen that there remains ſtill ſomething, which the weakneſs of our underſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, nor likewiſe how the Devil ſeduced</hi> Eve.</p>
               <p>Examining the temptation of our Lord by the Devil, I agree that the Tempter is the evil Spirit; and I believe that the literal Senſe may very well paſs, ſuppoſing that it was a wicked Man ſo called. But I ſhew, that underſtanding theſe words of the evil Spirit, literally; the quite contrary may be inferr'd from what is ordinarily gather'd from thence. Thereupon, if I be ask'd how I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and explain that narration? I anſwer, That I believe that the thing was done in a Viſion. See how <hi>Schultetus</hi> ſpeaks, who as well as <hi>Voetius,</hi> has been a member of the national Synod of <hi>Dordrecht:</hi> in his <hi>Exercit. Evang. Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to know, <hi>whether the thing really happend, or in a viſion?</hi> he anſwers, <hi>it was in a viſion,</hi> and after gives ſome reaſons, which however I do not judge ſo ſtrong as mine. None has right to require from me, that I ſhould preciſely explain my ſelf upon the paſſages of Scripture, and upon others: from which they ſuppoſe to draw ſtrong proofs in favour
<pb facs="tcp:59386:28"/>of that Opinion, the truth of which I here call in queſtion; nor that I ſhould declare what ſenſe I give them, eſpecially to thoſe who mention the fall of the firſt Man in Paradiſe, and the temptation of our Lord in the Deſart. For I have had no other deſign on this occaſion, but to examine whether theſe paſſages, underſtood according to the Letter, afford ſufficient proof to make us admit the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that are uſually drawn from thence, and to eſtabliſh the common Opinion which is had of the craft and power of the Devil to act upon Men. If it were neceſſary to proceed farther, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all theſe paſſages to the bottom, in order to penetrate their true ſenſe, a whole Book ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. I refuſe not however to do it, and hope to undertake it, as ſoon as the Divine Providence will furniſh me with occaſion and leiſure.</p>
               <p>I ſhew, as to other paſſages of the Holy Writ, that they cannot be underſtood of evil Spirits, but only of ill Men; and of the works of God, not of thoſe of the Devil; thô without heſitating, theſe paſſages are ordinarily applyed to the Devil. I maintain in the 22 <hi>Chapter,</hi> that it was a Man which brought <hi>David</hi> to number the People, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. that the paſſage, wherein the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> againſt the Devil, is mention'd, is very obſcure, and that there is a great uncertainty in the preſent Opinions upon that point, as all Divines grant; and that by conſequence, nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from them, eſpecially if it be ſuppoſed, as ſome learned do, that the Devil was but a meer Man. I ſhew in <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. That the Spirit of <hi>Python</hi> that is ſpoken of in the 16th <hi>Chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> can no ways be applied to the Devil. Neither does the famous Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> always alledged one of the firſt, as a proof of his power, being well examined in its whole extent, attribute
<pb facs="tcp:59386:29"/>to him the leaſt part in the evils, which by the Providence of God, happen'd to that Holy Man. As to the Angel of Satan which tormented <hi>St. Paul,</hi> I place him in the ſame rank with the fight againſt <hi>Michael,</hi> that is in uncertainty, there being no ground to pretend to a perfect underſtanding of this paſſage; and therefore I look upon it as inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove any thing which is the matter of the 25th <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the Poſſeſt are univerſally alledg'd for a certain proof of the great power of the Devil, and that we read ſo many times in Scripture, that the evil Spirits have been caſt out by our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I beſlow five <hi>Chapters</hi> upon examining what is in it. I ſee that the term of <hi>Diabolus,</hi> which we Tranſlate <hi>Devil,</hi> is not found in any of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in which thoſe Relations are contained; but only that of <hi>Daemon,</hi> which I illuſtrate in the 26th <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the 27th I ſhew, that the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſes, eſpecially thoſe of the Head, were uſually aſcribed to <hi>Demons,</hi> or even call'd by the name of <hi>Demons;</hi> and in the 28th, that our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> has not changed the uſual way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but made uſe of them according to the cuſtom of that time; neither did he always immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute all the errors, in the 29th and 30th <hi>Chapters;</hi> ſo that the cure of <hi>Daemonia,</hi> was not properly an expulſion of Devils, but a miraculous cure of incurable Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>I come after to other paſſages of Scripture, where neither the names of <hi>Devil, Satan,</hi> or <hi>Demon</hi> are made uſe of, but thoſe of the <hi>Prince of the World, Prince of the power of the air; Prince of this Age, of Lordſhips, Powers, Dominions,</hi> and the like; And I ſhew that there is not the leaſt cauſe to apply them to the Devil; but that the Stile of Scripture leads us of it ſelf to underſtand by all theſe names a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order of perſons.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:29"/>
               <p>Having then examined all, I could not conclude, that the Scripture, conſidered truely and without prejudice, attributes to the Devil this power and theſe operations, which the prevention of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Tranſlators diſcovers in it: I grant it has been very troubleſom to me to be obliged to take this party, and to confute and cenſure very famous Men and moſt approved interpreters: It even ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that I expoſed my ſelf very much becauſe I know that a more advantageous opinion is had of thoſe that are not known, and that a Prophet is neither eſteemed in his own time nor in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For this Reaſon I did firſt reſolve not to meddle with thoſe of Scripture, where I found my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to go from the expoſitions ordinarily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But at laſt, conſidering that my work would appear but imperfect, and that they would not fail to object thoſe famous paſſages, to which I ſhould be then obliged to anſwer; I at laſt prevailed with my ſelf to venture in the main Sea, and to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none that came to attack me; further I do not believe that any one can ſhew me, that the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I make, are founded upon the light of reaſon and humane underſtanding, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular propoſition I ſhould have aſſerted; ſuch as this is ſaid to be, that a Spirit cannot act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a body, nor upon other Spirits I have made uſe of for this effect, but of the ordinary means that the knowledge of Languages afford us; ſo there is no more unjuſt accuſation then that which is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>And therefore when I compare with the analogy of the whole Scripture, with the grounds of our Divinity, and with the rules of true Piety; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ordinarily publiſhed concerning the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Devil, his power, his operations, his apparitions in divers places in the World, his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:30"/>and the Kingdom which he raiſes againſt that of Jeſus Chriſt; I conclude not only that they are not grounded upon theſe three principles, but alſo being conſidered with all the neceſſary attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they appear contrary to them. In this place I begin to enter into diſpute, and to draw my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from arguments which the Scripture and reaſon furniſhes me with; having by the means heretofore eſtabliſhed upon thoſe two principles, ſearched after the ways how plainly and without equivocation to underſtand the ſtate of the queſtions which properly and particularly cocern the Devil. This is not then the point in queſtion, to diſpute of the meaning of thoſe paſſages which mention the fall of Man, or ſpeak of Angels, ſome of whom appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others wreſtled with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> or of the tentation of Our Lord Chriſt in the deſert; nor of the ſenſe of thoſe that ſay <hi>David</hi> was tempted by <hi>Satan,</hi> and that <hi>Job</hi> was tormented by him, and the like places; but the Chief point, the ſcope of all this ſearch, is to know what to believe concerning the Devil.</p>
               <p>Upon this I beſtow the five laſt Chapters, and in the three firſt of theſe five, which are the 32th, 33th, and 34th, I am not afraid of calling Reaſon to my aſſiſtance; after having ſhewn that the Scripture is ſilent upon this ſubject, for I preſume to have made appear in the 32th Chapter, that the apparitions of Evil Spirits are contrary to true Reaſon, and that the Holy Scripture affords no proofs of it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the 33th Chapter, I ſhow, that the knowledge that the Devil may have, as well of things Natural as Civil, and above all of things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, which concern our Salvation, is nothing of what is believed. I reſt as yet upon the ſame foundation of Scripture and Reaſon, to prove the Empire of the Devil is but a Chimera, and that he
<pb facs="tcp:59386:30"/>has neither ſuch a Power, nor ſuch an Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is ordinarily aſcribed to him, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 34th Chapter. At laſt, after having treated of all thoſe things with all poſſible exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I come to the concluſion of my ſecond Book, where I ſhew the importance of this examination by reaſon of the great value the vulgar put upon the Devil, and his Operations in the World. My Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that theſe ſorts of Diſcourſes ſhake the Grounds of the Doctrine of our Salvation, and cauſe a great damage to Piety in divers occaſions. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the firſt. of theſe things in the 35th Chapter, and the ſecond in the 36th.</p>
               <p>As to the Doctrine, I prove in this place what I have aſſerted in the firſt Chapter of my Book, <hi>viz.</hi> that the common Opinion concerning the Devil is oppoſite to the proofs that <hi>Jehova</hi> is God, and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles are the Word of God. In what concerns Piety, I ſhew, that the Service of God is thereby greatly weakened; that the Filial fear is very much diminiſhed by that they have of the Devil; that the eſteem that the holy Angels deſerve, is almoſt deſtroyed, that the glory and virtue of the miracles of our Saviour Jeſus, are very much leſſened, that the vanity of Man is maintained and increaſed; and that the comfort of the humble is cut off, or at leaſt, ſuffers a great diminution. That is whatever is contained in my ſecond Book.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An Abridgment of the Third Book.</head>
               <p>After having thus ſimply treated of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Spirits, and particularly the Devil, according to the knowledge that ſound Reaſon can furniſh us
<pb facs="tcp:59386:31"/>with, according to that which may be drawn from the word of God, where Reaſon ceaſes; I paſs ſtill following the order and diviſion eſtabliſhed in my firſt Book,) to thoſe Men, who, according to the common ſentiment, have communication with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, eſpecially with the Devil. The ſame order to which I have kept in my ſecond Book, is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this; for in the eight firſt Chapters, <hi>I</hi> make an exact ſcrutiny of all which may contribute to clear the ſubject I treat of, and afterwards in the ſeven laſt, I ſhew what light the inquiry has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and how far one can rely upon what I have diſcovered.</p>
               <p>I propoſe at firſt the true ſtate of the queſtion, ſhewing that the query is not, Whether Magick is poſſible, for I grant it; but whether there is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which by the virtue of agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and the Devil, may diſcover hidden things, predict thoſe that are to come, and produce effects above the force of nature. This is diſcuſt in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Following the diſtinction that I have already heretofore many times ſet down, I make in the firſt and ſecond Chapters, the ſearch required, and that firſt by the light of Reaſon; which I divide it into two parts: in the firſt, I examine, whether it be poſſible to conceive that Men have any commerce with Spirits; that the one and the other may rely upon mutual help, or that they may act one upon another, In the ſecond part, I examine whether there is Reaſon to believe, that there may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs compacts between them; that they may mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contract, and reciprocally perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Covenants. I expreſly deny the firſt of theſe, founded upon the Reaſons alledged, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and I unfold a little more preciſely in the 2 Chapter of this, what is contained in the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:31"/>firſt, which I defend againſt the arguments of <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil an Engliſh Author.</hi> I beſtow the third Chapter upon confuting thoſe compacts of the Magicians with the Devil, as ridiculous and altogether incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and I anſwer at the ſame time, ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and ſhifts of <hi>Glanvil,</hi> convincing him by his own Reaſons that are ſufficient for that purpoſe. I paſs afterwards to the Scripture, as to an upper School; from the 4th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the 7th, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it over from the beginning to the end, to find out with the utmoſt exactneſs, what it diſcovers to us upon this point, and upon all it's dependencies either by it's expreſſions, or by the examples it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us. Than I begin to eſtabliſh what we may believe of it according to Scripture.</p>
               <p>As an Introduction to this examination, I relate all the names it gives to that ſort of People, to their trade and art, and I compare the difference to be found between the tranſlations of our own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well as between the tranſlation of others.</p>
               <p>This examination is but general, but afterwards I come to particulars, whether the Scripture ſpeaks of that ſort of People, of their trade and arts, ſo as it is ordinarily ſuppoſed. This I do from the fifth Chapter to the 12th, but finding it expreſſes not it ſelf as they give out, I examine what ſort of People they can be, and what the Scripture really ſays of them, from the 13 <hi>Chap.</hi> to the 17th.</p>
               <p>I diſcuſs the firſt of theſe, as well by Scripture as Reaſon, and proceed by degrees; ſearching, firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe of whom the Scripture ſpeaks, have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular communication with the Devil; whether they make their predictions and enchantments by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking or by his power; and at laſt whether they have between them covenants for that purpoſe. The paſſages of Scripture which I examine upon
<pb facs="tcp:59386:32"/>this ſubject, are of three ſorts, ſome contain Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that kind of People, and of their Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts which I ſhow in the 5th 6th and 7th <hi>Chapters, viz.</hi> In the 5th all the enchantments of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> in the 6th, thoſe of <hi>Bilſa,</hi> thoſe of the Prieſts of the Philiſtins, and of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and many others, by whom the idolatrous Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into great Sins, eſpecially when they came to the Court of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and in the 7th Chapter, the enchantment of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Elimas,</hi> who are called enchantors; thoſe of the maid ſervant which was in the Town of <hi>Philippi,</hi> who had a Spirit of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> and thoſe of the ſeven Brothers Exorciſts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I come to the examination of the names, of words, of actions, and circumſtances, as well by themſelves as comparing the Dutch tranſlations of the Scripture, with thoſe which have been made in divers Languages, by different Tranſlators, and by comparing with the texts, the explications which are given by ſo many different interpreters. All the paſſages where thoſe things are contained, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined very attentively, give cauſe to conclude, that the Magicians or Enchanters have been very miſcheivous People, whoſe Doctrine and morals were very much corrupted; but they do not furniſh any probable argument to aſſert, that theſe People had a particular communication with the Devil.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Order of the paſſages of the Holy Writ upon this ſubject, conſiſts of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the expreſs Laws, which condemn that ſort of People, and forbid them the exerciſe of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which I examine in the 8th and 9th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But I find no other Reaſons for thoſe Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions and the puniſhments inflicted upon them, but their Idolatry and Cheats, both of which are Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and not becoming the People of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:32"/>
               <p>The third Order conſiſts in thoſe Reaſonings and Proverbial Expreſſions, diſperſed through the whole Scripture, that have relation to thoſe things, either to the Perſons themſelves, or to their ways. I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine therefore whether nothing can be underſtood in thoſe places, whence ſome conſequence may be drawn to illuſtrate the ſubject in hand: But having beſtowed the whole tenth Chapter upon it, I find nothing more than before.</p>
               <p>Now as in the third Chapter, I have examined by the light of Reaſon, whether there is cauſe to believe the poſſibility of the communication of Men with the Devil by expreſs Covenants, I do here the ſame by that of the <hi>Holy Writ.</hi> For in the two following Chapters I run it over again, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all the paſſages, where the leaſt mention is made of Alliances, or Compacts, that are not made with God but againſt Him, ſinfully and with an evil deſign; I find not ſo much as one that ſpeaks of thoſe Agreements made with the Devil, or any thing like it. Upon this I beſtow the 11th Chapter. In the 12th I run over again the whole Scripture from the beginning to the end; From the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to our Saviour, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether from whatever has been ſaid upon that ſubject, there is any occaſion to infer, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may likewiſe on his part make his deteſtable Compacts; I demonſtrate, that the Opinion, which ſuppoſes ſuch Contracts between the Devil and Men, by vertue of which they are ſaid to have perform'd all their Witchcrafts, can by no means conſiſt with what is contained in the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> nor with the Diſpenſation of God's Covenant, as well before the Law as under the Law, and much leſs under the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:33"/>
               <p>Thus I plainly ſhew, that the vulgar Opinion of Magick, and of its Dependencies, by no means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Sacred Writings, but on the contrary is altogether oppoſed to it. Afterwards we muſt conſider what the Scripture ſays concerning thoſe that practiſe that Art, and what Teſtimony it gives of their Actions. This I do two ways, in the five following Chapters. The firſt by offering, in the 13th and 14th, the lively Picture which the <hi>Holy Writ</hi> gives of thoſe Men in ſeveral places; and the ſecond by ſhowing what Opinion muſt be had of them according to the Character given them.</p>
               <p>But expounding to the Reader the force of thoſe things, I make yet this diſtinction: That I firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Perſons to his view, that he may know what might be expected from them; what their aim may be; why they were interrogated; and on what the great Men and the vulgar beſtow their time. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the 14th Chapter, I conſider them in themſelves, with their Arts and Crafts, ſhowing the Reaſons that moved the People, eſpecially the Kings, even thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be infatuated by them.</p>
               <p>Afterwards 'tis required to know what Judgment muſt be made of them, according to the <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> which I ſhow in the three following Chapters. In the 15th, I aſſert, that in whatever they did, they ſhewed neither real Power nor Virtue; that they knew nothing of what they ventur'd to foretel, or to diſcover as very much concealed; and that in reality they effected nothing of what they boaſted of, or of what they undertook to effect; but that they applied themſelves to deceive by outward ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, wherein conſiſted the chief part of their Art. In the mean while, as the Holy Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ms, by its Expreſſions in ſome places, to aſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:59386:33"/>a great vertue to Conjurations and Enchantments; I examine in the 16th Chapter, what is the Senſe of thoſe places, and I conclude that after an attentive Meditation it will not be found that it ſays upon that ſubject what it appears at firſt to ſay.</p>
               <p>All theſe things being thus enquired into, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to ſhow wherein properly conſiſts all the Evil; why thoſe Men with their Arts, eſpecially the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> that had a hand in their Crafts, are ſo defamed in the Bible; why, ſince that time they have been in as great hatred amongſt Chriſtians, who have mortally deteſted them, and puniſhed them with the utmoſt rigour; And laſtly, for what Reaſon the Laws have been ſo ſevere againſt them, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their Arts, as well under the Old Teſtament as under the New. This is the Enquiry of the 17th Chapter. I have hitherto ſpoken only of thoſe who pretend to a Converſe with the Devil, and to be in a Covenant with him; I add in this place a Chapter, which is the 18th, where I mention thoſe to whom he is an Enemy, whoſe Mind is ſuppoſed to be troubled, or their Body to be tormented by him; thoſe are the poſſeſt, as they are ordinarily call'd, but I enlarge not much upon that ſubject, having already fully clear'd it in my ſecond Book, from the 26th Chapter to the 30th, where it came to paſs.</p>
               <p>Having thus ended the firſt part of my third Book, I ſhow what Judgment muſt be made of all thoſe things, which I conſider in two Reſpects. Firſt, I eſtabliſh from the 19th to the 20th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what may rationally be thought of it; and in the laſt Chapter, I ſhow what is the Duty of a Chriſtian, and how he ought to behave himſelf in ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:34"/>
               <p>A double judgment may be formed upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Firſt, concluding that the Vulgar Opinion is altogether groundleſs and condemnable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the 19th, 20th, and 22th Chapters. Secondly, By eſtabliſhing what muſt be held of it.</p>
               <p>Concerning that firſt and common Opinion; As in the Writings made againſt my ſecond Book, ſome expreſſions of our Liturgy have been objected, I ſhow in the 19th Chapter, how weak are the Grounds upon which are founded the principal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, whoſe Doctrines are in ſhort in <hi>Voetius;</hi> and that the Proofs they alledge are not taken from the Senſe of the Holy Writ, well examined and ſearcht into; but only from the external ſound of Words, if I may ſo ſpeak, upon which we are wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as well as upon the Idea's that firſt offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us, when we conſider them but ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. To which I add, that Liturgies muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the Senſe of the Scripture from whence they are drawn, and to which they relate in all thoſe places, where 'tis ſpoken of the Temptations and Seductions of the Devil, Spiritual Combats, Witchcraft, Predictions, Enchantments, and even in all others where the agreeableneſs of Style, and the Series of Idea's has cauſed ſomething to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſeems to have a relation to it. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in the 20th Chapter, I demonſtrate, that the Errors ſpread amongſt the vulgar concerning the Works of the Devil, and his Adherents, are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely oppoſite to the ſame Liturgies; even ſo far, that amongſt the Doctors of the Reformed Church, none but thoſe that are of my Opinion can pretend to conform in this point to what they ſubſcribed when they took Orders; which I underſtand only as to the Doctrine and Truth. I ſhow again, in the
<pb facs="tcp:59386:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>21th Chapter, that this Opinion makes very bold attempts upon Piety; that it diminiſhes the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to God, that it extreamly weakens Faith and Charity, and that it expoſes Chriſtianity to the attacks of the Unfaithful, and that it cauſes great diſtractions and prophanations in our Prayers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I proceed further and to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I diſcover in the 22th <hi>Chapter,</hi> what muſt be believed of all theſe things, and in the 23th I declare what muſt be done. But as in the 32th <hi>Chapter of the</hi> 2d <hi>Book,</hi> I have treated of apparitions in general, I ſpeak here of preſages and predictions in particular, examining what is poſſible or not, as to theſe things, and to what cauſes they muſt be aſcribed. Theſe cauſes, according to the Proofs I have related in this place, are natural, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil meddles not with them: I propoſe my thoughts in the ſame manner upon the Conjuring up of Ghoſts, the divinations of the pretended Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and all ſorts of apparitions and poſſeſſions, which are ſaid to be cauſed by their malice, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the compacts they have contracted with the Devil; and laſtly I ſhow what ſort of Magick is practicable in the World and which is not.</p>
               <p>I declare in the <hi>laſt Chapter but one,</hi> what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be had of thoſe men that credit Apparitions and Witchcrafts; And ſtick not however to converſe with thoſe that meddle with thoſe deteſtable Arts; And in the <hi>laſt Chapter,</hi> what is our Duty, and how we are obliged to behave our ſelves in that reſpect. We muſt double our devotion and veneration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, our moderation and charity towards our Neighbours, our modeſty in our actions, and our zeal in the exerciſes of Piety. Such are the Contents of the 3d <hi>Book.</hi>

               <head>An Abridgment of the 4th Book.</head>
               <p>There would be reaſon to believe that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is exhauſted; but it ſeems experience carrys it above Reaſon; and being grounded upon matters of fact and inſtances, it ſeems that it will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us: Our Adverſaries appeal to its Tribunal, and plead their cauſe with ſo many ſtrong and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating reaſons, that it ſeems they deſign to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us by their multitude. This conſideration obliges me to add this 4th <hi>Book</hi> to the 3 preceding, and to examine what experience actually teaches, that it may be no more objected, that by my new Doctrine, I undertake to contradict opinions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and eſtabliſhed through all the World; where almoſt no place is to be found, but it affords plain inſtance of the operations of the Devil; of which I dare even deny the poſſibility. I diſtinguiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Inſtances into thoſe, that any one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his own experience, and into thoſe that are grounded upon the relation of others; there's no doubt but what one has experienc'd himſelf, muſt prevail over all the reſt. But to omit nothing, I firſt ſhow how far one may truſt to his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and afterwards how far we may rely upon the teſtimony of others. I diſmiſs the firſt of theſe queſtions, in the <hi>firſt eleven Chapters;</hi> and he Second in the 21 following, adding two others at the end as a concluſion of the whole.</p>
               <p>I diſtinguiſh again each of thoſe parts into two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; having thought convenient to ground upon many examples; the inſtructions and illuſtrations I give upon both, that no body may eaſily be deceiv'd. What I eſtabliſh as to the firſt part is contained
<pb facs="tcp:59386:35"/>from the <hi>beginning of the 5th Chapter,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are the matter of the following Chapter to the 11th: But I could not ſo exactly follow the ſame method in the 2d part, having thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or at leaſt uſeful, in ſome places, to mix with examples the illuſtrations I give at firſt, and with the illuſtrations, the inſtances I produce afterwards.</p>
               <p>I therefore ſhow in the firſt part, that there are few Men amongſt us, that are capable of paſſing a ſolid Judgment upon that ſort of things, and that beſides that our occaſions will not allow either to examine, or to ſearch into whatever could be neceſſary, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a naked and full knowledge of all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact. I aſcribe the firſt of theſe faults, to the prejudices with which we are imbued, or to the terror with which we are ſurprized, at the ſight and hearing of what paſſes. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the firſt Chapter: I demonſtrate in the 2d, that this cauſe alſo proceeds, from that we know not ſufficiently how far the ſtrength of nature may extend its operations: In the 3d <hi>Chapter</hi> I aſſert, that we know not more of the things, the Images of which nature may only ſhow us, when they are not real, nor we ſo far knowing as to obſerve all the tricks of men; nor of ſufficient Authority to obſerve all the circumſtances of their Actions: I ſay again, we are not Skilful enough to penetrate the Force and Virtue of Arts, which encreaſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the exerciſe we make of them, and of the care we take to cultivate them, and make us look upon meer natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>acidents as effects of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. Of theſe I have alledged many proofs in the firſt Chapter; ſhewing afterwards in the 5th, that often we want only the occaſion to diſcover the Myſteries of the Artifices of Men, and the ſecrets of the operations of Nature.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:36"/>
               <p>I begin in the ſame <hi>5th Chapter,</hi> to produce ſome inſtances of Apparitions. In the 6th, I ſpeak of the Poſſeſt and Bewitched, as far as I am acquainted with them, and thereupon I declare in the 7th, what judgment I make of that <hi>famous Parot,</hi> which was thought to be bewitched, comparing that caſe with another known to me from my own experience. From thoſe bewitchings of the Body, I paſs to the Enchantings of the Soul, and mention in the 8th <hi>Chapter,</hi> what I have ſeen my ſelf happen to many perſons in ſeveral places, eſpecially at <hi>Franeker.</hi> In the 2th I deſcribe a very remarkable Hiſtory, which happen'd in the ſame Town, and which has been the greateſt occaſion of exerciſing my ſelf upon this ſubject. To this I joyn the Impoſture of the <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft of Campen</hi> that has been lately diſcover'd, of which I have been informed, both by word of mouth and writing, by underſtanding Perſons that were preſent, and have themſelves laid open the whole Intreague, having had a full knowledge of the whole matter, from the beginning to the end. Wherefore I have inſerted the Narration, word for word, in the 10th <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the 11th I relate the Cheat of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulin Nuns of</hi> Londun in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory having been lately publiſhed, manifeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the deluſions of the pretended Poſſeſſion, and withal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the Magick, with which they charged the innocent Prieſt <hi>Grandier,</hi> whom they cauſed to be burnt.</p>
               <p>The illuſtrations I have made upon the Firſt Part, make the inſtructions I am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> give upon the Second, more eaſy. I beſtow 12 Chapters upon them, ſtill following the Rules I have before propoſed, which to my beſt knowledge, are univerſally approved of; <hi>viz.</hi> To admit as Truth, no Advices, Narrations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Teſtimonies, how confidently ſoever they may
<pb facs="tcp:59386:36"/>be told, before we have examined them with a full exactneſs, and made experiments upon all thoſe caſes and inſtances, the truth of which is propoſed to us as undeniable.</p>
               <p>That I may, if poſſible, leave no perplexity, on darkneſs in my work; I make yet a diſtinction upon this laſt point. For I propoſe in four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all the Inſtances I have been obliged to inſert in ſeveral places of my Firſt Book, to facilitate the underſtanding of the things contained in it, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with thoſe that concern the Ancient Heathens that are in the Third Chapter of that Book, and in the Thirteenth of this.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that relate to the Modern Pagans, in the 6th, 8th, 9th and 10th Chapters of the Firk Book, are contained here in the 14th. Thoſe that I have drawn from the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tof the 15th, and thoſe that were afforded me by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the 19th, 20th, and 21ſt, of the Firſt Book, are confuted in the 16th of this.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I run over the whole Univerſe, from the 17th to the 32d <hi>Chapter,</hi> relating and examining the moſt famous examples, and thoſe that are thought to be the ſtrongeſt proofs for the common Opinion. I alledge firſt in general, thoſe that are moſt ordinary and familiar, concerning Apparitions and Magick. Such are the Apparitions of the <hi>Fairys,</hi> that were ſo much talked of in our Country, as the <hi>Fairy of Roſemberg,</hi> and the like, in the 17th Chapter. In the 18th I ſpeak of thoſe that pretend to be invulnerable to Sword and Muſquet-Ball, and I prove that all the Diſcourſes and Narrations made upon that ſubject, are altogether falſe. I come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to examine particular Relations. And Firſt, of thoſe that can have no particular name, or properly be called Apparitions, Divination, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft;
<pb facs="tcp:59386:37"/>or Poſſeſſion; becauſe they are made up of ſeveral kinds of Witchery, of which Poſſeſſion uſes to be the Principal. This is the matter of the 19th and 20th Chapters. In the 21ſt, I paſs to Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in the 22 to Divinations; and afterwards to Witchcraft, from the 24th to the 32 Chapters.</p>
               <p>I relate but Three Inſtances of the Firſt ſort. The Firſt, is the going out of the Children of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>elon</hi> in 1284. The Second, is the Devil <hi>Zechariah,</hi> whom <hi>Volſcius</hi> mentions in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Churches of Sclavonia,</hi> which Inſtance I expound in the 19th <hi>Chapter,</hi> as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of whatever may be invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or practis'd as to this. The Third is, the ſtory which happen'd Twelve years ago at <hi>Bolſward,</hi> that was publiſhed with very extraordinary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: I relate it in the 20th Chapter.</p>
               <p>I come afterwards to ſuch Caſes as have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reference to Apparitions and Witchcraft, or enchantments, if there be any ſuch. Of the Firſt kind, I produce <hi>the famous Devil of</hi> Maſcon; And having taken off the vail from the Cheat, I deal in the ſame manner with <hi>the Spirit of</hi> Tedworth, that was lately brought again upon the Stage to frighten me. The Queſtion is, Whether they have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Deſign? of which, the Reader ſhall be able to judge by the 21ſt Chapter. He will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find in the 22, a full deſcription of the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm that appeared a year ago at <hi>St. Aneberg;</hi> and of another Story which happen'd the laſt Summer at <hi>Lauzanne,</hi> contained in a Letter, written with the hand of a Miniſter of that Town, whom they would trouble with it, which I think ſufficient to ſhew what Opinion muſt be had of <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms.</hi> But as to <hi>Divination,</hi> there occurs the moſt ſingular and ingenious Story which I ever heard of, that happen'd whilſt I was writing this Treatiſe; and having begun at <hi>Lyons</hi> a Year ago, is ſtill in
<pb facs="tcp:59386:37"/>force to this Day. It concerns a <hi>Man,</hi> who by the motion of a <hi>Wand,</hi> he carryed in his hand, boaſts of diſcovering ſprings of Water, hidden Gold and Silver, Robbers and Murtherers. I give a ſhort account of the different relations made of it, with the judgments of the learned that are all contrary to one another, and I examine what may be thought of it after a ſerious conſideration,</p>
               <p>But before I ſpeak of Magick, I examine in the 23 <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſuch proofs as are drawn from the very confeſſion of thoſe that are detained Priſoners, as guilty of that crime; and I demonſtrate, that nothing in the World is leſs worthy of credit, than ſuch confeſſions. Thence I take occaſion to examine the proceedings and enquiries of the Judges that take notice of it, and ſhow their nullity and injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I come to the chief proofs, that have been alledged for Magick, either far or near, long ago or lately; and begin with a caſe which happened within the walls of our City of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in the houſe of the Orphans about the Year 1570, whilſt the Inhabitants profeſt as yet, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, to which I add another ſtory, which happened at <hi>Hoorn,</hi> in 1670, with that of <hi>Antoinette Bourignon,</hi> which ſhe has related her ſelf; all the circumſtances of it having happened in her ſight at the Hoſpital of <hi>l'Iſle.</hi> In the 24th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I ſhow what judgment muſt be made of ſuch ſtories. In the 25th I ſpeak of that Woman of <hi>Abbekerk,</hi> that thrice publiſht, ſhe was become miraculouſly with Child; and has been held not long ago every where for a famous Magician, in the Years 1658 and 1659.</p>
               <p>From that ſort of People that are only look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Magicians by the Vulgar, I come to thoſe that have been condemn'd for ſuch, by the ſentence of Judges, and by conſequence put to Death. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:59386:38"/>not ſuch as have been ſet down by <hi>Schottus,</hi> and ſome other Authors, becauſe it would be to no purpoſe, ſince they may be ſeen in their writings. I only relate ſuch new inſtances as are come into my knowledge, that I may leave no room to obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor be charged of having paſt by ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact as might have perplex'd me, and to which I had nothing to reply. For that Reaſon, I firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what happened in our own Country, from the very time of the Reformation, and mention in the 26th <hi>Chap.</hi> the Hiſtory of thoſe that have been burnt here for Magick, as one at <hi>Schoonhove,</hi> and 4 at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tretch;</hi> as alſo another ſtory, of one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed of the ſame crime, had been condemn'd to the Rack, by the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> and was acquitted by the ſupream Council. This happened in the Years, 1591, 1592, and 1593. Thence I go over to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in the 27th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I make an examination of that black Art that was ſaid to be practiſed 80 Years ago, at <hi>Kogen</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> a Province of that Kingdom. I likewiſe examine all the other particular events, worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that happened in that Country, and were publiſhed ſeveral times in the Daniſh Tongue, and from that tranſlated into Latin and Dutch. To which I add a ſtory of another unhappy wretch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted this very Year. From thence I go over to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in the 29th <hi>Chapter,</hi> I relate what is inſerted in the Royal Records, concerning that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Magick that began to appear in 1669, and again in 1670; and a third time in 1674, to which I add another ſentence delivered to me by a perſon that ſaw the execution of it, at <hi>Golnaw</hi> in <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I afterwards mention the Magick practiſed in the <hi>Weſt of England,</hi> the falſehood of which I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb facs="tcp:59386:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>my ſelf, and gave the Hiſtory of it to the publick. This is the matter of the 30th <hi>Chapter.</hi> The 31th contains a judicial information made at <hi>Harlingen,</hi> with a letter written to me upon that ſubject from <hi>Leuwarden,</hi> which contains ſeveral other matters of fact concerning Magick, happen'd about the Years 1667, and 1668. I conclude this Chapter with the relation of a caſe that happened in the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 7 Months ago, which has been lately communicated to me, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it having been diſcovered whilſt I was writing this 4th part.</p>
               <p>Some People may ſuppoſe it uſeleſs to add narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a leſs conſequence, after having ſhown the groundlſeneſs and deluſions of more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable facts, But I thought, that in reference to the Vulgar, it was convenient to add here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chapter,</hi> that is the 32th, where I relate the <hi>Story of a Child in Friezeland,</hi> it was ſuppoſed to be bewitch'd, of which I have had a full account by the letters of his friends and relations; that by this ſpecimen any one may judge of all the narrations of that nature, that are ſo much credited by the common People; who take ſuch matters of fact for undeniable effects of Magick. As for the reſt, ſhould I make an enquiry after all the examples that are reported to prove the Operations of the Devil, I ſhould never compaſs my end. And therefore I perſwade my ſelf, that I have alledged a ſufficient number of them to ſatisfy the Reader, who ſhall not be able to doubt of their truth; becauſe I have produced ſuch as are moſt known, lately happened, and in neighbouring places; or at leaſt attended with one of thoſe 3 circumſtances, and conſequently may be examined with great conveniency and certainty, and teſtified for the moſt part, by living perſons.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59386:39"/>
               <p>Thus I put an end to this Treatiſe, and make my concluſion, briefly rehearſing all the proofs related in the 4 Books, each in it's place. Theſe proofs ſhow that there are no natural Reaſons, nor Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the Holy Writ, no certain experiments, that give us cauſe to aſcribe to wicked Spirits, all the Operations and effects that are generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to proceed from the Devil or from Men, his Confederates. This is contained in the 33th <hi>Chapter,</hi> whereupon it muſt be remembred, that what I ſay concerns only the common Doctrine and Opinion. Afterwards 'tis not difficult to ſhow, how wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuch a ſuperſtition is cheriſhed and increaſed, inſtead of moderating it, or even rooting it out, if poſſible. In the 34th Chapter, I charge with that fault, Clergy Men and Divines, more than Princes and Magiſtrates; becauſe the former are more particularly obliged to meditate upon thoſe matters, to watch over the preſervation of the Souls committed to their care, and to attempt the cure of a Diſeaſe that is ſo contagious, and feeds upon the very Bowels.</p>
               <p>But becauſe 'tis probable, that this undertaking will but ſlowly proceed, I will in the mean while propoſe to the Reader and my ſelf, the leſſon of the Apoſtle in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reject prophane, and Old Wives Fables, and exerciſe they ſelf to Godlineſs.</hi> I ſhow, in the 35th and laſt Chapter, that this is what I chiefly intend in this work, and that I obtain my end in moſt of thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Rending of it, with ſuitable diſpoſitions. Beſides I hold it for certain, that thoſe who take occaſion or pretence from thence, to accuſe me with error and libertiniſm, are Men themſelves that have not for the word of God, all the deference that could be wiſht. This I demonſtrate in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb facs="tcp:59386:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>with ſo great evidence, that I have already had the ſatisfaction to ſee that my work produeed a great fruit, when but one half of it appeared. So that I hope by the bleſſing of God, it being now finiſhed, I ſhall gather as plentiful a Harveſt, as the ſorrows which it cauſed to my Enemies, whilſt I was publiſhing it, were uneaſy and ſmarting.</p>

               <p>I Promiſed to undertake this Work a long time ago, and 'tis yet longer ſince I projected it: 'Tis now at laſt come to its perfection; but I am afraid to venture too much by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of it, my own Experience in ſeveral Occaſions, and my frequent Converſing with very Rational Men, together with my particular Study, have a thouſand times afforded me the occaſion to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59386:44"/>conſider, Whether it was poſſible, that whatever the Vulgar, and the Learned ſay of Devils, and whatever they aſcribe to them, were true? I would not have ſpar'd ſo much time as to ſearch into this matter, had not I perceiv'd that the Opinions of moſt Men, and perhaps of all the World, are only grounded upon an unſure and wavering Foundation. This has moved me impartially to examine ſeveral things, which my Calling, and common Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered to me. This examination forced my Mind to reject many Opinions which I had admitted at firſt, only becauſe they were common; though grounded upon inſufficient Reaſons, as I came by degrees to be ſenſible of; ſo that I find that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I know much leſs than I formerly imagined to do, eſpecially as to the ſubject in hand. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I do not ſay with a deſign to Cenſure, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, what others have Written: I only intend to joyn my Thoughts to theirs for a fuller Inſtruction of ſuch Readers as love Truth, and are enquiring after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. I am not afraid to miſtake, if I ſay, that whatever belongs to this matter has not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. Thoſe that have written upon it before having been ſomewhat retarded by Prejudices, that ſtick to their Mind, though they had freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of many others; for I own they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to deſtroy moſt of the works of the Devil; at leaſt ſo far as 'twas neceſſary to free Men from Superſtition and frivolous Fears: But, as for me, I would, if it were poſſible, altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, and not leave one Stone upon another, that ſhould not be demoliſhed. And therefore I'll try whether I can bring my Countrymen to my Opinion, eſpecially thoſe of my Profeſſion, deſiring them to read this Treatiſe with as little prejudice as I have written; and not to ſuffer themſelves to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59386:44"/>by other Reaſons, but such as proceed from Natural Light, from a clear Interpretation of the Holy Scripture, and from certain Experiments. I have right to require theſe Conditions from the Reader, ſince they cannot be rejected by any Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Perſon, that they are a Law to which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf, and that the great conſequence of the matter requires them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. I am Confident, and I hope, that the Reader will more plainly perceive it hereafter, that no point of the Chriſtian Religion is more important than this; and that no certain and ſufficient proofs may be had of all the others, than by rejecting the Opinion commonly receiv'd amongſt the Vulgar, concerning the Craft and Power of the Devil. Can it be imagin'd a ſmall Matter to know whether the Devil has a Kingdom upon Earth; and what are the Limits that ſeparate his Dominions from that of God Almighty? Or is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> unſerviceable to examine, whether ſuch a curſed and deteſtable Creature can do more wonderful things than God ever did; and conſequently, whether the truſt we repoſe in God, and the fear we have of the Devil, ought to be equal? Such Thoughts ought never to enter into a Chriſtian Heart; yet they creep into it unawares; at leaſt I think ſo, and can ſcarce doubt of it: for the more I ſearch into this matter the more it ſeems evident to me; that whoever entirely believes all that it uſed to be aſcrib'd to the Devils and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all that is commonly ſaid of them, both by the Learned and the Vulgar, ſaving the bottom of the Doctrine publickly receiv'd and taught in our Church; he can have no convincing proof that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or that there is but one God: And if in this Writing I do not make the Reader very ſenſible of it, I grant that I have compoſed it to no purpoſe.</p>

But if I ſucceed, it will at the ſame time plainly appear, that it was altogether neceſſary to publiſh this Treatiſe, becauſe the Vulgar are ſtill confirm'd in their Errors by Men of Letters, and of great Name; who, being full themſelves of thoſe prejudices, make uſe of their Tongue and Learning to lead others into the ſame Labyrinth. To that end they wreſt ſeveral Expreſſions and Hiſtories of the Holy Scripture; which being not accurately examined, nor conferr'd with others, give a great probability to the common Opinion concerning the Devil; but if taken in the ordinary Senſe, they prove evidently oppos'd to other clear Expreſſions concerning the Fundamental Articles of our Faith: It follows, that ſuch a Senſe cannot ſubſiſt without overthrowing the grounds of our Salvation; that I can hardly bear, ſince a long time the nicety with which Points of ſmall conſequence, or at leaſt of little certainty, uſe to be treated of; ſince one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcuſs them without getting into a ſuſpicion of entertaining Erroneous Opinions; whilſt, in the mean time, we are not yet agreed upon Matters of the utmoſt conſequence; or if we are agreed upon them, it 'tis without any foundation: And therefore, ſince none was ever found fault with for defending an Article of Faith, or giving out a new Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; ſo I perſuade my ſelf, that I do well by publiſhing the Illuſtrations upon a matter, on which the whole Edifice of our Salvation is grounded; in order that whoever will carefully and impartially examine it, may become Wiſer and Learneder.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. As to what concerns this Book, I will at firſt ſet down the ſubject matter of it before the Reader. The deſign is to examine to the bottom what the Devil can do, and what he really doth; that is, How far his Knowledge extends; either in Natural or Supernatural Things. Either as to the Preſence,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59386:45"/>as it is conceal'd from Men; or as to the Future, as it is contingent, or poſſible, and not neceſſary. Moreover, what Direction or Power he has to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in Nature, what Communication he has with Men, with the Human Soul, and with all ſorts of Bodies? That he ſhould tranſmute himſelf into them, or put on their various Forms: That he ſhould act upon the Soul, or upon the Body: That he ſhould direct Thoughts, Words, Actions, and Geſtures: What is his Power over the Beaſts and Fruits of the Earth; Over the Air and Winds: What his help may contribute to the Knowledge of Man and his Actions. Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>Auguries,</hi> or Soothſaying, Witchcraft, the Art of Conjuring up Ghoſts, and of Divining Dreams. All which things are methodically (and in the ſame order that is mentioned here) treated of in this Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. But becauſe the perfect Knowledge of them depends upon another, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spirit, wherein it conſiſts, and how it's diſtinguiſhed from that of the Body: (for Devils are undeniably Spirits, and Man is compoſed of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a Spirit) ſo it will be neceſſary in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to proceed farther, and to examine firſt the Nature of Spirits, Good and Bad, and then that of Man. Beſides, God himſelf being a Spirit, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and independent, we ought not to pay our ſelves with the conformity of the Name; but by reaſon of the manifeſt difference betwixt the Creator and the Creature, we are obliged more particularly to examine, how much the increated Spirit differs from thoſe that are created; and amongſt theſe laſt, how much thoſe that are immaterial, and thoſe that are united with a Body, differ from each other.</p>

However, ſuch a difficult piece of work cannot be undertaken, without knowing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions and Practices upon this Subject; and without ſpecial Conſiderations upon them: Now, whoever ſhall reflect upon what is ſaid and practic'd, as to this matter, through all the World, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon the converſe, which Men may have with the Spirits, and the Operations that may attend them, he will undoubtedly deſire to be well informed of all theſe things, that he may diſtinguiſh betwixt the Truth and Falſhood of thoſe Opinions, and what is lawful and unlawful in thoſe Practices. For theſe Reaſons I deſcribe all the Sentiments that have been receiv'd amongſt Men, in all Ages and Places whatſoever, concerning God and the Spirits; what means Men have made uſe of to conjure them up and down; and what they may be able to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the help of thoſe Spirits: whence proceeds a ſufficient matter for a more particular examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what ſound Reaſon, and the Holy Scripture teach us, as to this Point, and what experience teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. To treat of theſe things methodically, I have divided this Treatiſe into four Books. In the firſt I propoſe the Opinions and Cuſtoms of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in all Ages, Countries, and Religions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Deity, and the good and bad Spirits. I ſay the Opinions and Cuſtoms; for in the matter we undertake to treat of, we muſt take a ſpecial notice of theſe two things; the Knowledge, and the Action; Since no Fruit can be perceived from the Knowledge, but by putting it into Practice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we fee every where that the Behaviour of Men, either in the Words or Actions, has a relation to the Doctrines they have been taught. For this Reaſon I have again divided in two parts, the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of what is contained in the firſt Book. In
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59386:46"/>the firſt part I enquire what Knowledge may be had or Spirits, of their Power and Operations, according to Reaſon and the Holy Scripture; which Enquiry is the matter of the Second Book. In the other part, which is the ſubject of the Third Book, I examine thoſe Sciences that are ſaid to be grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; as Witchcraft, Divination, Conjuring, and the like. Moreover, as Men uſe to have recourſe to experience, not only in things which are not diſcover'd by Reaſon, and of which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent; but alſo eſpecially in this Caſe, in which Reaſon, and the Holy Writ, are made to ſpeak, according to the certainty which we ſuppoſe to have acquired by Experience: This Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has furniſhed me with the matter of the Fourth Book, in which I examine all that Men teſtifie ever to have experienced in themſelves, or profeſs to have done.</p>

As to Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have to conſider thoſe that are not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſuch Chriſtians, as may be called Spurious. The Firſt are the Heathens, who never worſhiped one true God, or the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who keep as the mean betwixt them and us; or the <hi>Jews,</hi> who Worſhip one God only.

After we have obſerv'd the diſpoſition of all theſe Nations, ſhe ſhall more eaſily examine what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and practiſed amongſt us. As to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Cuſtoms that were formerly in uſe in thoſe Countries, in which Chriſtianity is at preſent eſtabliſh'd; and betwixt thoſe that are ſtill practiſed amongſt thoſe Nations, that have not yet been illuminated with the light of the Goſpel. We ſhall now proceed in that order.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59386:47"/>as are ſtill moſt or all the reſt of the World. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who inhabited thoſe Countries, that are in the Grand Seignior's Dominions, were the moſt famous People in the World, by reaſon of their Learning and Religious Worſhip. Next to them came the <hi>Romans,</hi> and moſt of the Nations, who ſtill keep Communion with the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For proportionably as the <hi>Romans</hi> extended the limits of their Empire, ſo they ſubjected the conquer'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the Worſhip of their Gods, and to their Religion, ſo that their Doctrine and Worſhip ſpread every where, and drew to themſelves an Univerſal Awe and Veneration. From them therefore we muſt know the Cuſtoms of our Forefathers in the time of <hi>Heatheniſm;</hi> but we cannot accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what was their Belief concerning Spirits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we know, at leaſt in general, their Opinions and Practices, concerning God and inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. But the great difference and Diviſions, that were amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves upon this Account, leave us extreamly in the Dark, as to the Opinions that are to be aſcribed to them. However, we may agree upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> to take that ſtupendous number of differencies for an Uniformity; ſo that it may he affirmed, that in all Ages, the <hi>Pagans</hi> have Unanimouſly believed, that there is but one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God, the Firſt Univerſal cauſe of all things; ſince the Firſt Doctors of their moſt famous Schools, and the heads of their principal Sects, have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taught this Doctrine to their Diſciples. The Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that Old Father of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Religion, may be ſeen in <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who writing againſt the Heathens, did doubtleſs not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpare them; however he ſays, that <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> owned one God, an immaterial Spirit diffuſed and extended through all Nature, who gives Life
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59386:48"/>and Senſe to all beings. <hi>Plato,</hi> who has deſerved the name of Wiſe, by all the ſucceeding Ages, agrees with him, as to this point, as appears by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in his four Books of the Laws. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>God in whom, according to the Ancient Teſtimonies, is the beginning, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the end of all things, penetrates every where, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his great Diſciple, who for Two Thouſand Years, has been eſteemed the Prince of Philoſophers, plainly ſayes in his Firſt Book of <hi>Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> the 7th. that <hi>God is Eternal and perfectly good, ſo that the Eternal and Infinite Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in him.</hi> From this capital point they infer this other Belief, that the good and evil, which befal Men, proceed from the Firſt and Univerſal Deity, as <hi>Plato</hi> more largely explains in the forementioned place. <hi>Equity,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Eternally attends him, which is the Avenger of thoſe that forſake the Law of God, but happy is he, who ſticks to it, and follows it conſtantly.</hi>

But how advantageouſly ſoever they may ſpeak of the ſupream Deity, it nevertheleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they do not aſcribe to him Independency, nor the immediate direction of all things; ſince they divided the Government of the World betwixt ſeveral Gods, to each of whom they aſſigned his particular ſhare. 'Tis very probable that the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> obſerving how Human affairs were often here below obnoxious to conſiderable changes, which proceeded from Heaven, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from thence, to contrive two ſupream Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, proceeding from that Firſt being; one of whom they called <hi>Oromasdes,</hi> and gave him the direction of Heaven; to the other, named <hi>Arimanius,</hi> they aſcribed that of the Earth. The <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards gave them the Greek names, <hi>viz.</hi> to the former that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and to the latter, that of <hi>Pluto,</hi> whom they at Firſt look't upon as the God of the Earth.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59386:48"/>And becauſe all the wiſe held for a certain Truth, that the Heavens ſurpaſs the Earth in perfection, they placed the ſupream Deity in Heaven, and the other Gods under it, each according to his Dignity: And as they conceived that the Soveraign God could never ceaſe from being good, ſo <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who had the Empire of the Heavens, was in great credit amongſt them; but <hi>Pluto,</hi> the God of Hell, obtain'd but an ill name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. It is here, methinks, the proper place to diſtinguiſh the Doctrines of the <hi>Pagans</hi> into ſuch as had either Religion, or Nature, for their object. In the latter, they enquired after the Firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes of all things, of their Motion and Changes, without any reference to Religion. Thus came upon the Stage <hi>Plato,</hi> with his Idea's, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with his Intelligencies, <hi>Plato</hi> called <hi>Idea</hi>'s the principles that flow from the Divine Nature, that ſubſiſts with him, and by which all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; each of them being as an Engraven Image of him, from whom they all proceed; ſo that they all partake of the Nature of their Original, and are ſuch as the principal, from whence they flow. When I confer the ſentiment of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> contained in the words of <hi>Socrates,</hi> related in the <hi>Parmenis,</hi> with what <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes in his Firſt Book, Chap. the 10th, <hi>of the Opinions of Philoſophers;</hi> and <hi>Laertius</hi> in the Life of the ſame <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as alſo <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the Firſt Book of the <hi>Tuſculan Queſtions.</hi> Fifty Eight, wherein he explains the meaning of that Philoſopher, it ſeems to me, that nothing can be better nor more plainly expreſſed, concerning this ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject.

But <hi>Socrates,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> relates in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Treatiſe, which contains his laſt Words, leads the Souls to ſome places, where they ſhall be Bleſſed or Tormented, without Bodies: He ſends thoſe who ſhall have done Good into the Upper and Aetherial Regions, where he believes the moſt pure part of this Orb to be, and where the Soul ſhall Eternally live without the Body, in an unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Felicity. Whereas he condemns thoſe of the Wicked to the <hi>Tartarus,</hi> which is a deep and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Abyſs, where they ſhall be puniſh'd according to their Deſerts. From that Gulf of Torments he draws four Rivers, to which he gives as many Names, very fit to expreſs his Notion, <hi>viz.

As to the Firſt, we find in the Authors, and in ſeveral others, that every one was eager to obtain the favour of the Gods, whether great or little, and that they earneſtly ſought to pleaſe the good Spirits, and to turn off the evil. To this end they built Temples, eſtabliſh'd Forms of Prayer, conſecrated Prieſts, offer'd Sacrifices, inſtituted Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals and Games of all ſorts. Beſides that, they uſed ſeveral means to diſcover the deſigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Gods, together with the happineſs and misfortune of Men; to which they ſuppoſed to attain, either by the Knowledge they might receive from the help of the Demons, the communication of the <hi>Penates,</hi> of the <hi>Remures,</hi> by the means of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59386:54"/>Conjurations and Witchcraft, or by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the influence of the Stars, the motions of the Air, the dreams of ſleeping Perſons, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring up Ghoſts, by inchantments, for which they made uſe of Carcaſſes, by Prognoſticks drawn from the days of the year, the hours of the day, or the meeting of Men and Beaſts. Whatever was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as to this point amongſt the Romans, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Divination,</hi> that properly ſignifies <hi>an exerciſe of things concerning God,</hi> of which, <hi>Cicero</hi> has written a particular Book. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. relates, in what conſiſted all thoſe Arts.

There, were two, ſorts of Divinations Anciently in uſe amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> the one was rightly called <hi>Natural,</hi> but the other <hi>Artificial,</hi> they held for a <hi>Natural Divination,</hi> what ever a particular, free, and voluntary Action of the Mind of Man, without the help of Reaſon, or any Conjecture, or Prognoſtick, portended as future, as it often happens in a Dream, and even without Sleeping in the Fits of a raving Fever, thence the Goddeſſes called <hi>Furies,</hi> had their Name and 'twas believ'd, that ſome Prieſts, and even the <hi>Sybil, Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threa</hi> had begun to utter their Oracles in ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſins. <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> gave their Anſwers in ſuch a way, and by ſuch ſort of People of which their Prieſts themſelves boaſted. And as thoſe Perſons were eſteem'd ſincere, and to act in the courſe of Nature, the vulgar aſcribed to their affected <hi>furor;</hi> what a long Obſervation and a frequent experience cauſed them to diſcover, or to foretell upon concealed or future things. The chief and moſt famous of thoſe divining Arts were <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the Art of <hi>Haruſpices,</hi> or foreteling, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59386:55"/>the inſpection of the Bowels of ſanctified Beaſts, beſides <hi>Auguries,</hi> and caſting of Lots.</p>

To this ſort belong the Caſe recited by <hi>Apian</hi> in his ſecond Book of the Wars of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and by <hi>Cicero,</hi> namely, that no Heart was found in an Ox, which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, the firſt day that he ſate on the <hi>Golden Seat;</hi> wherefore the Diviners told him, that ſuch a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting could not prove happy to him.</p>

That ſo much exalted Art obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Birds three ways, in their Flight, in their Singing, and their Eating: As to their Flight, they made their obſervations upon the <hi>Praepetes,</hi> that is, on <hi>ſwift flying Birds;</hi> as to the Singing, they drew their conjectures from <hi>Oſcines,</hi> or <hi>Singing Birds;</hi> and as to Eating, they obſerved the <hi>young Chickens</hi> Amongſt the 4th ſort is ranked the caſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> from whoſe hands an Eagle took a

Whence the good or bad fortune of the Inquirer was inferr'd.

As to the Heathens, as often as the Demons, Geniuſes and <hi>Larvae,</hi> medled with their Dreams, it was to offer them ſomething particular, by which, according to the uſual Rules of their Art, they might know the good or bad ſucceſs of future things.</p>

                     <hi>Divinations,</hi> and caſting of Lots ſays he, are as much in faſhion amongſt them, as any where elſe. They caſt their Lots in a very ſimple way, for they cut the branch of a Fruit-tree in ſeveral little Lots, on each of which they make a particular mark, and then Confuſedly throw them on a piece of white Cloth. There the Prieſt, if matters of State are treated of, or the Father of the Family, when it concerns him, or his houſe looking to he Heavens, lifts up thrice each little Lot, and gives the explication of the marks printed on them; if they diſſwade, no farther conſultation is made that day; but if they allow to proceed, they go to the Diviners for an Anſwer. There is yet another particular way of predicting amongſt that people, by the means of white Horſes, that were never back'd, and are kept together in a Foreſt at the Publick Coſt. They hunt them, and the Prieſt, King or Governor ſitting on a conſecrated Chariot, obſerves their Neighing and Foam. There is no Divination more eſteemd than this, not only by the People, but even by the Great Men and the Prieſts; the

I have hitherto treated of thoſe Arts, that to ſay properly, are Sciencies, ſuppoſed to be acquired ſeveral ways, by the Communication with the Gods, or with the Spirits.

'Tis very probable, that when thoſe Men were got at Court and in great eſteem amongſt the Vulgar, their Art was not ſufficient to keep up their Reputation; then they begun to uſe Craft and Cheats, and even ſome of them, abuſed that Art ſo far, as to joyn Malice to Deception, and not to ſpare either the Goods, or the Blood or ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſo that as on the one ſide, the Pagans extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured that ſort of People, becauſe of their Wit and parts; ſo they deſpiſed them upon another Account, and had a great hatred for them. Thence proceeded that ſome have Anciently been famous in the Magick Art, as well for the good, as the bad uſe they made of it, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tyanis,</hi> whoſe Life has been written by <hi>Philoſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Elymas,</hi> who reſiſted St. <hi>Paul, Acts,</hi> 13. <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. And the Wiſemen of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> who were called to expound the Dreams of their Kings. <hi>Gen. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. And <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. Even <hi>Moſes, Daniel,</hi> the Wiſemen of the Eaſt, who ſought the King of the <hi>Jews</hi> newly born; all thoſe Men were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Magick, thô Authors ſpeak variouſly of them, either with or againſt them, there is ſo much difference betwixt the ſame Sciences and the ſame Actions, by the good or bad uſe that is made of them. Nevertheleſs, it was properly that Art, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59386:60"/>which we now give the name of Magick. <hi>Agrippa</hi> of <hi>Nettinheim,</hi> diſtinguiſhes it in Two ſorts, one of which may be called <hi>Natural Magick</hi> and the other <hi>Artificial;</hi> becauſe the firſt having Natural cauſes, produces Natural Effects, but the Second being an invention of Art, Nature has no ſhare in it's Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I mean that as it is neceſſary in all Arts and Handicrafts, that Nature ſhould ſupply the matter and power of Action, thô the Workman imploys them this or that way, only by the rules of his Art. It goes even ſo with the Artiſts of whom I ſpeak, and not as which a Husbandman, who can only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Ground, caſt his Seed upon, or plant a Tree upon it, but muſt expect the Harveſt and Fruit from Nature it ſelf, holpen with his Art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <q>They believe, ſays <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magick</hi> is but the higheſt Degree of power, in Natural Sciences; for which Reaſon they call it the <hi>extream and laſt perfection of the knowledge of Nature;</hi> ſaying, that it is the active part of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wiſdom, which, by the help of Natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſed in proper time, operates wonderful effects, and raiſes Admiration. The <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> made a ſpecial uſe of that Magick, that is, as much as it was able to produce effects, by the power of Herbs, Stones, and other things of the ſame kind. Moreover, ſays again <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for that Reaſon, Natural Magick is that, which penetrates the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all Natural things, and which with a ſubtle diſcerning, having exactly ſearched into their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durations, and Sympathies, diſcovers ſo far their ſecret powers, that by them it produces wonders, which amaze Humane underſtanding; not ſo much by Art, as Nature, to which, as to its Soveraign Art ſubmits it ſelf, and only lends her the helping Hand.</q> Thus we can by Natural ways produce ripe Fruits before their Seaſon, and even infects,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59386:60"/>only by ſupplying the want of time, by Natural means unknown to other Men; as it is done, thô in a leſs Degree of perfection, by Gardners, each of whom, ſtrives to be the firſt in getting early Fruits, helping Nature by Art, and ſtill however by the means of Nature her ſelf. The difference only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that a <hi>Magus,</hi> who wholly gives up himſelf to his ſtudy, penetrates much farther into the knowledge of the power of Nature, than the Vulgar, and even thoſe learned, who care not to take that trouble upon them. But as all theſe things are done without the particular aſſiſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of God and the Spirits, they concern not the preſent queſtion; however we mention them, that we may learn to diſtinguiſh them from the ſubject in Hand, and all it's dependencies, of which we intend to give a clear and undeniable notion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. We have hitherto ſeen the Magick of the Pagans, included within the bounds of Nature. Now I deſire the Reader to remember what I have ſaid in my Commentary upon <hi>Daniel, Sect.</hi> 26. <hi>viz.</hi> That to the Magick antiently in uſe <hi>Mathematicks, Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> were ordinarily conjoyned; ſome giving up themſelves to one of thoſe Sciences, and others to another, whence proceeded a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Names, betwixt the Students of Magick; ſome of whom were called <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and others <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> or by a more odious name, <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</hi> The former applyed themſelve chiefly to perform wonderful things; and the others to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate Wickedneſs. Amongſt their Wonders may be counted the Wooden Dove of <hi>Architas,</hi> that fly'd, and the Statues of <hi>Mercury</hi> that ſpake; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of <hi>Poiſoners</hi> was to annoy Men, their Goods and their Beaſts, by many things commonly unknown. And having learned the Virtues and Properties of them by their Study, they put them, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59386:61"/>uſe in ſuch a concealed and imperceptible way, that one could ſcatce belieye what he ſaw effected; and this is, what they really operated. But as to what they boaſted of beſides, or perhaps, imagin'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves capable of; it was, that by the virtues of Simples, and ſome other Drugs mixed together, they could transform Men into Beaſts, Beaſts into Men, Beaſts and Men into other Beaſts and Men, conjure up Ghoſts, or raiſe the Dead out of their Graves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Now we muſt ſpeak of Magick meerly <hi>Artificial,</hi> which may rightly be ſo called, becauſe Nature has no ſhare in it; but that is a work of Art alone, which however preſuppoſes Nature; one may alſo very fitly give the names of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Conjuration, and Inchanting in general, to all the various practiſes that are made of it; for we call Witchcraft whatever is operated by the power of the Devil, with the communication of Men, which is never done, without uſing ſome ſort of Conjuration , and Inchanting. That Art which required of its Profeſſors a particular way of living, always conſiſted in the uſe of ſome certain Signs and Words, that they utter'd or wrote, and in extraordinary Geſtures, in conſideration of which, the Demons were ready at all times to diſcover to them hidden things; and to operate in their behalf, ſupernatural Wonders. This was therefore the opinion of the Heathens, that beſides natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, they believed themſelves capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the moſt wonderful effects by the power of Demons, whom they knew how to make comply, by their Conjurations, to whatever they deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. We muſt carefully obſerve this, becauſe, <hi>natural Magick</hi> is not commonly accurately diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>Artificial,</hi> either by the Antients or by the Moderns; and that which belongs to one,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59386:61"/>is frequently attributed to the other: even thoſe that meddle with it, having committed as many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes as the others. <q>For ſome of them, ſays <hi>Agrippa,</hi> are come to that heighth of Folly, as to believe, that by the different Concourſe and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of the Stars, with the interpoſition of time and proportions duely obſerved, they may, in a certain inſtant, acquire a ſenſible Idaea of Celeſtial things, and a Spirit of Life and Underſtanding; which being Interrogated by them, will give them Anſwers, and diſcover 'em hidden things.</q> On the other ſide, they aſcribe to Nature what is above her power, which I cannot better expreſs, than by the very words of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who proceeds thus. <q>I deſire you to take notice, that thoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> not only rake up into natural things, but even in a manner remove Nature out of her place; which they endeavour to do by Motions, by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by Geſtures, by Sounds, by Voices, by Congregations, by Lights, by the Inclinations of the Mind, and by Words. Thus it was that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Pſilli</hi> and <hi>Marſi</hi> conjured Serpents, and put them to flight; thus <hi>Orpheus</hi> by his ſinging allay'd the Tempeſts, for the ſake of the <hi>Argonauts;</hi> Thus, as <hi>Homer</hi> relates, by ſome certain words, the blood of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was ſtopp'd. There was a puniſhment ordained by the Law of the 12 Tables, to thoſe that ſhould uſe ſuch ſort of Inchantments againſt Corn.</q>

The ſame <hi>Agrippa</hi> will tell us, in the words of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> which was the opinion of the moſt ingenious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon that ſubject. <hi>Porphyry</hi> ſays he, <hi>treating of Witchcraft, and of the Magick of Divine things, concludes at laſt, that it may render the Souls of Men capable of receiving Spirits and Angels, but he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denies, that one may approach God by that Art.</hi>

It is the more neceſſary to enter into that examination, that we ſhall ſee, withal, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of very many Nations, arid that the proofs they ſhall furniſh us with, of the uniformity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (that which we contend to be amongſt the Heathens) will then be more general and extended, then ſuch as are drawn from the Writings of thoſe we have already ſpoken of, of which <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has taken place; ſince they inhabited only a ſmall part of life World, and have given us in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

Experience teaches us, that we cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divide the World, then as into three great Iſlands; one part of which was known to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greeks and Romans, though not perfectly: The ſecond part is come to our knowledge, ſince about two hundred years: The third is yet for the moſt part unknown. The firſt is called for that Reaſon the <hi>Antient World,</hi> divided into <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> But in the North of <hi>Europe,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is not much greater than one half of the other, there are ſtill many Heathen Inhabitants. In <hi>Aſia</hi> the Chriſtians are hardly the tenth part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and about the third part of the reſt follow <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet;</hi> ſo that the greateſt number is ſtill Pagans.

I anſwer, that having ſhown the Reader that three parts of the known World, conſider'd as divided into five, are ſtill Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, he cannot but infer, that we are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of the Cuſtoms and Sentiments of the Heathens concerning Spirits, by the Books of thoſe Nations that ſubſiſt no more, and who never made up the tenth part of the Inhabited World: and therefore we muſt not keep there; but 'tis likewiſe fit to examine the Opinions of thoſe many Nations, who are not yet Chriſtians, whoſe uniformity upon this queſtion, notwithſtanding ſo many other things, in which they differ, and with all the great diſtance of the places they Inhabit, which cuts of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Communication betwixt them; ſo that the greateſt part of the one never heard ſo much as one word of the other: That Uniformity, I ſay, is an evident proof of the good, which the common light of the Underſtanding remained in Man after his Fall, has preſerved in him; and of the evil which the general corruption has brought to the fame. And when we come to the examination of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that will help us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt thoſe general Truths, and thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mixtures of Corruption.

'Tis not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to proceed in this enquiry farther, then it's requiſite to ſhow that all thoſe People agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo with the Ancient Nations, thô there is never ſo great a difference in their Language, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and time.

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. In the mean while it will not be uſeleſs to obſerve, that all the Authors which <hi>Carolinus</hi> has follow'd, and which I am likewiſe oblig'd to follow, are <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and therefore they have ſet down the Belief and Worſhip of thoſe Heathens, only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the particular Information they received from the Heathens themſelves, or the things that they ſaw them practiſe, ſo that they cannot afford us ſuch a clear and neat knowledge of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as is that which may be gathered from the Writings of the Ancient Heathens, who have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their own Tongue, treated of their own Affairs. And therefore we cannot relie ſo much upon the deſcriptions of the preſent Heatheniſm, which are made by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who undoubtedly have but ſeen or learned part of the Sentiments and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the People they ſpeak of, and who perhaps, are not diſpoſed to make ſuch a ſimple and natural relation of them, as could be deſired. Now I find that all thoſe Writers are in the fame prejudice, when they tell us, that there are many Nations who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59386:64"/>adore the Devil himſelf, vexing themſelves with grievous pains, and cruel torments, to be his Martyrs: But the miſtake of thoſe Authors, ſeems to me to diſcover it ſelf, for he that has been quoted before, ſays in the <hi>7th Chap.</hi> of his 1ſt.

IT has been already ſaid, that there are ſome <hi>Pagans</hi> in the extremity of <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts, but they are ſo brutiſh and wild, that it is eaſier to ſee what they do, than to conceive or gueſs what they believe. They are <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> eſpecially thoſe <hi>Swediſh</hi> Dominion, with whom we are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, by a description drawn from the beſt Authors, which <hi>Scheffer</hi> has made in his <hi>Swediſh Lapland;</hi> and therefore I ſhall declare as much as I judge convenient for my deſign; Firſt, what he ſays of theſe, and afterwards what is added of the others; yet without giving credit to whatever is written, of which I ſcarce believe one halfe to be true. This however, is certain, that thoſe People, tho' under the Dominion of Chriſtian Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Swedeland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> are as fond of their Pagan Superſtition, and continue as zealouſly, tho' ſecretly, their antient practiſes, as they have little knowledge of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to embrace our Faith. In the mean while, <hi>Scheffer</hi> has made of late ſuch an accurate deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Lapland,</hi> and upon ſuch certain information, that one may, methinks, ſurely relye upon what he ſays; and as he frequently intermixes in his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, other <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> it may be probably inferr'd that he eſteems them all very near alike in Belief and Worſhip: which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by this reaſon, that what other Writers ſay
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59386:65"/>of thoſe other Nations, is pretty agreeable with what <hi>Scheffer</hi> relates of <hi>Swediſh Lapland.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall follow him only, tho' I ought not to ſay him only, ſince his Book contains whatever the others had written before him.

They believe that he reſtrains thoſe Demons, when they vex Men too much; that he chaſtiſes them, that he ſometimes Thunder-ſtrikes 'em, and puts 'em to death, eſteeming it to be the chief employment of the Thunder, as the eminent <hi>Latins</hi> imagin'd that <hi>Jupiter</hi> caſt his Thunderbolt upon the wicked, and all other Criminals; for that purpoſe they give him a Bow, which they imagin'd to be the <hi>Iris</hi> or <hi>Rainbow,</hi> that he might dart his Arrows, wound and kill all the wicked Demons.

'Tis upon thoſe Opinions that their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations and Witchcraft are grounded, and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I can't but make this obſervation, that by reading <hi>Scheffer,</hi> and comparing what he fays of his own, with what he has collected from other Authors, it may eaſily be perceived, that the Witchcraft of the Northern Nations extends not ſo far as is commonly reported. But then we muſt credit what <hi>Scheffer</hi> aſſures us from his own experience, in the following words, Chap. 12. <hi>Tho the preſent</hi> Laplanders <hi>do not frequently nor publickly exerciſe Magick, their Anceſtors having been more addicted to thoſe ſuperſtitions, of which moſt of the modern Laplanders are free, and thô the Country be purified of that ſort of Witchcraft, ever ſince the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>has forbidden, under grievous pains, to uſe Inchantments: yet there are ſtill a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amongſt them, who make it their whole ſtudy and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. The cauſe of it is, that every one of the</hi> Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers <hi>is perſwaded, that Magick is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to him, that he may avoid the ſnares and inſults of his Enemies.</hi> To this he adds, <hi>That they kept Schools, in which Children are taught that</hi> Art, <hi>and that Parents are often their Tutors in it.</hi> That they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them in it, required their aſſiſtance, and are preſent at the performance of thoſe deteſtable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. But what is yet more ſtrange, is, what this Author farther relates, <hi>That the Fathers bequeath, as an Inheritance to their Children, the, wicked Spirits that were in their Service, that by their help they may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Demons of other Families, their Enemies.</hi>

What they pretend to effect, by means of their Gods and Spirits, is to diſcover ſome things by Divination, and to operate ſome others by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft; for Divination, they make uſe of a <hi>Kannus,</hi> which is like a <hi>Drum,</hi> and muſt be made of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Wood, and rather of Birch-tree than any other. <hi>There is a Skin, or Membrane, extended upon the Body of that Drum, wherein the</hi> Laplanders <hi>draw ſeveral Figures with a red colour made of the Bark of Alder-tree, bruiſed and boyl'd; they beat it with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument like a Hammer, 6 Inches long but not bigger then the little Finger, not ſo much to make a noiſe, as to cauſe a bundel of Braſs Rings, that lies upon it, to move, when that bundle begins to leap up they obſerve the parts and Figures towards which it moves, and Divine by the Scituation, Motion, and reſt of the bundle, on the place which ſignifies the deſign they have form'd. The manner of this enquiry is not always the ſame, for they make uſe of ſeveral, different from one another, by thoſe means they diſcover, what paſſes in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, how diſtant ſoever they may be; they know the good or bad ſucceſs of the Affairs they have undertaken, they cure Diſeaſes, they find out what Sacrifices and Victims are moſt pleaſant to the Gods of the Land. Theſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the State of their Friends or Enemies, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Thouſand Miles from that place, have but to go to a</hi> Laplander, <hi>who diſcovers it this way. He caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Ground, and becomes tike a Dead Man, and his Face altogether livid. He remains in that ſtate an hour or two, according as the Country, whence he will get News, is more or leſs diſtant, and when he awakes, he tells whatever paſſes in that Country, eſpecially as to what is enquired after.</hi> There are yet ſome other particulars, as to that way of Divining, gather'd from ſeveral Authors, but it would be too long, and even unſerviceable, to relate them.</p>

But it may be ſeen in <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> what account they themſelves make of the Gods of Thunder, and of the Spirits in the Air.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there is another ſort of Devils, or <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſias,</hi> properly ſo called, becauſe they are the Children of <hi>Aditi,</hi> and are very Malitious. They have power to moleſt Men, and even to cauſe much trouble and vexation to the Angels, or <hi>Deuetas.</hi> They may walk every where, except ſave in the abode of <hi>Brama,</hi> and in the Heavens.

Chiquiao <hi>is a Sect, which our People eſteem to be the firſt introduced in</hi> China, <hi>after the Birth of our</hi> Saviour. <hi>They believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of Souls inwardly and outwardly. They Honour Images, and imagine that the Soul after Death paſſes in puniſhment of her Sins from one body into another; for which reaſon they abſtain from what ever has had life.</hi> That Narration is confirmed by <hi>Trigaltius,</hi> who ſays, That the Parents are not afraid of killing their Children to be diſcharged of them, when they are incumbred with too many, aſſerting, that by that means they procure them a better Condition; ſince inſtead of Poverty, they afford them by Death the occaſion of going into other Bodies, and being Born again in the Houſe of Richer People, where they will live more at eaſe. The <hi>Peguans</hi> ſeem to have the ſame Sentiment by the Relation <hi>Piuto,</hi> when by the Tomb of their <hi>Rolym,</hi> or <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> they let looſe a great many Birds and Fiſhes, which they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59386:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>kept Priſoners, believing them to be as many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souls, who will keep company to their <hi>Rolym</hi> in his way to the other World.</p>
               <p>Beſides we read in <hi>Corolinus,</hi> out of <hi>Artus,</hi> in his <hi>Speculum Mundi, That the Wiſe Men of</hi> China <hi>have invented three places for thoſe that depart this Life.</hi> Nachac <hi>is a place of Torment;</hi> Schuum <hi>one of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſuch as the Paradiſe of</hi> Mahomet; <hi>and</hi> Miba, <hi>or</hi> Nibam, <hi>ſignifies an entire, privation of being, or a full Deſtruction of Body and Soul. All the Souls have their abode in the two firſt places, or depart from thence, to go to and fro through the World, and often paſs from one Body into another by new Birth, until they deſerve. to enter into the</hi> Nibam, <hi>that is, to be annihilated. Le Blanc</hi> ſpeaks of it ſomewhat differently, in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation extracted from a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monk. He ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Chineſe <hi>believe that Men become Gods at laſt, after they have paſſed through the Bodies of ſeveral Beaſts, Birds, and Fiſhes; and that they imagine that the Souls, after the courſe of many Ages, having been well purified in ſome proper places, and returned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times into new Worlds, are at last introduced into Paradiſe, caſt down to Hell, or reduced to nothing.</hi>

As to the Opinion of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> in this point, we muſt learn it from the Relation of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in their Journey to <hi>Siam,</hi> in the years 1685. and 1686. becauſe that Book is the neweſt and much credited.

Thoſe Angels are never Sanctified nor Deified:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59386:73"/>but to them only belongs to watch over the Government of the World, and the preſervation of Men. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute them into ſeven Orders, or</hi> Hierarchies; <hi>ſome of which are more perfect and noble than the others; all which they place in as many different Heavens. Each part of the World has one of thoſe Intelligences to preſide over what is done there. They likewiſe impart them to Stars, to the Earth, to Cities, Mountains and Foreſts, and even to the Winds and Rain. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are perſwaded, that thoſe Angels examine the conduct of Men, and are witneſſes of all their actions, to reward thoſe that are commendable, by vertue of the merits of their God; It is therefore to thoſe Intelligences and not to their God, that they uſe to apply themſelves in their neceſſities and miſeries, and to thank them for the favours they ſuppoſe to have received from them.</hi>

I cannot better expreſs that Thought, than by the very words of <hi>Carolinus,</hi> which, are as a re-capitulation of what has hitherto been ſaid. <hi>Some eſteem, ſays he, that the Souls are mortal, others eſteem them immortal; ſome eſtabliſh rhe tranſmigration of Souls, others are not of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and how much differ thoſe that aſſert the</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempſychoſis <hi>between themſelves; ſome, as thoſe of</hi> Java <hi>believe, that the Soul goes into the firſt Body ſhe meets with; others believe that ſhe is ſent into ſuch or ſuch Body, according as ſhe has merited by the good or evil ſhe has done, which is the Opinion of the</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janes. <hi>Some affirm, that the Souls change their abode but once, others three times, and others teach a vaſt number of Tranſmigrations; others make them paſs only into Men, who muſt alſo be ſtrangers; others again ſend them into Man and Beaſts; but others at laſt make them paſs only in the Females of Men and Beaſts; which is the imagination of the</hi> Thearau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achs; <hi>others have yet quite different Opinions.

That's the Duty of the Men. That of the Women, conſiſts in bringing the dreſs'd Hen in a Diſh, and placing her in the, middle of the</hi> Fetiſſos, <hi>thnn one of the Men begins his Conjurations, by drinking
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59386:80"/>and throwing a mouthful of Water, or palm Wine upon the</hi> Fetiſſos. <hi>He takes</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>leaves of thoſe Garlands, which he rakes up, and makes a little round Ball of it, he puts it between his</hi> 2 <hi>Fingers, and many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Feet or Toes, whence he draws it out, greeting the</hi> Fetiſſos <hi>as many times; when he has ſquezed all the moysture out of that green Ball upon his Gods, he makes another, and then another, till all the Garlands be ſpent, then out of all theſe little Balls, he makes one, with which he rubs his Face, which raiſes it to the dignity of a</hi> Fetiſſo, <hi>and cauſes it to be kept as an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt all ſorts of Evils, and a certain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in the War.

On the one ſide, we find that Nations, that extreamly differ in the Opinions they have concerning the Gods and the Spirits; yet on the other ſide, they wonderfully agree upon the ſame ſubject. They differ in the Names they give them, which is not ſtrange, the Tongues being ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and all the Nations not aſcribing the ſame properties to Spiritual Beings. Thence proceeds a ſecond difference, that they make not their number equal, nor diſtinguiſh them in the ſame manner, as to their Dignity and Adminiſtration, or as to their Operations, as it has particularly been ſhewn in the 2 <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 21. concerning the Inhabitants of <hi>Aſia.</hi> But the difference to be found amongſt them is not material, and muſt be accounted as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, comparatively to the conformity that

So that they have too high an Opinion of the Creature, and too deſpicable of the Creator. That miſtake, which proceeds from a confuſed Notion of what belongs to the Divine Nature, and to that of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beings, leaves them to groſs errors, and that are ſource of their Idolatry and Magick.

That they believe the whole race of the Gods iſſued from their Anceſtors, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are of Celeſtial Origin: from the ſame ſpring is derived the Sentiment of the Exiſtence of the <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Zemeans,</hi> that is of helpful Spirits, the

It is now eaſy to conceive on what ground are founded the Divination and Magick of the Ancients, that are the ſame with the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Witchcraft of the modern Heathens; for, as to their foretelling or Divination, it is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Every God has his People, whom he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and protects, or his own property; for which Reaſon, they put queſtions to him, concerning that which is to happen to his People, and what is to be done on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That every God has his Enemy; for which Reaſon, every one looks for help againſt the Gods of whom he is to receive damage, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the aſſiſtance of ſuch Gods, as are eſteem'd to be their moſt violent Enemies.</p>

                  <hi>Third.</hi> That every Man has his God or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Spirit, and therefore every one miſtakes his own paſſions, and whatever comes into his fancy, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpirations and motions; eſpecially when Dreams ſupply him with the occaſion of it; not knowing that the employments or accidents that have preceeded the Dreams, are the Origin of them, or being hindered by his prejudices, to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act enquiry after their poſſible cauſe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is not ſtrange, that diſtinguiſhing not only created Spirits, but even the Gods, into good and bad; they ſhould endeavour to ſet them one againſt another, and to defend themſelves by the help of the good, or of ſome of the wicked, againſt another; or to avenge themſelves by the power of one God, of the wrong they ſuppoſe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That having forged to themſelves ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of Gods and Spirits ſuperior and inferior, 'tis no wonder, they ſhould believe to deſtroy the power of the leſs, by the aſſiſtance of the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> That having ſo baſe thoughts of the Gods, whom they ſubject to the ſame paſſions as Men, and thus Deify human paſſions themſelves, they act conſequently, by ſtirring them up againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it comes into their fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> That putting ſome of their Gods ſo low, and in ſo great a familiarity with the Spirits, they ſeem to aſſume to themſelves, the quality of their Directors, and to be able to make the Divine Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, even in the moſt hidden things, ſubſervient to what uſe they pleaſe. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect</hi> 10. There is yet ſomthing to be ſaid upon Divination and Witchcraft together, which partly concerns the thing it ſelf, and partly the geſtures of the body uſed in it. What concerns the thing it ſelf, comes to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Opinion of the Heathens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Genii</hi> or familiar Spirits, and the Spirits wandring about Graves, makes 'em believe, that ſomthing may be operated by the means of Graves, and Carcaſſes; for which Reaſon, they uſe the bones of the Dead in their Witchcraft, and conſult them in their Divinations, in hopes of getting an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59386:91"/>anſwer from the Gods or Spirits, which operate in them, or abide near them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That according to this, their belief of the exiſtence of ſo many ſorts of Spirits, whereof moſt part are wicked Spirits, that walk and wander eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; they are always ready in any unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen diſeaſe, Mortality, or ſiniſter Accident, to caſt the ſuſpicion upon their Enemies or Envious, who have bewitchd them for believing that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Gods or Spirits act according to the Will of the Men to whom they belong, they muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently believe, that thoſe Men will not fail to effect reciprocally, the one againſt the other, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the help and power of the Spirits will allow. Now thoſe ſuſpitions, that will ſurely move Men to ſeek by whom they have been bewitch'd or the cauſe, matter, and foundation of Divination, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8, 16.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Corpereal Ideas, which they have of the Spirits and of the Gods themſelves, move them doubtleſs to uſe ſo many outward geſtures in their Conjuration, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect</hi> 16. But there is ſtill another Reaſon of that Cuſtom, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prieſts, who are Impoſtors, make uſe of them to impoſe ſo much the eaſier upon the ſimplicity of the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> Conſidering how the Opinion of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> is become almoſt Univerſal, it may be, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, conceived at the ſame time, how it was poſſible, that Men ſhould place ſome Virtue in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Numbers, by gathering and diſpoſing them, in ſuch or ſuch a way, and conſequently in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of ſome certain words; for the ſame <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> has believed, that the Virtue of the Deity, influenc'd the proportion, and Harmony of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Now the Letters of the Alphabet being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to mark the numbers, not only amongſt the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59386:91"/>
                  <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but by all the other Nations that have ſome knowledge of <hi>Letters,</hi> it follows, that ther's not one word, but it can make up a number whence it may rationally be inferr'd, that ſuch or ſuch a word, compoſed in ſuch or ſuch a manner, of ſuch or ſuch or ſuch Letters, more or leſs, has according to their Opinion, more or leſs power in Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> Beſides the ordinary numbers, they uſe alſo Names and Characters, as it is ſeen at this day, eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> whoſe enchanted Drums are ſpotted with the like Characters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. But I have nor yet ſpoken of what is moſt important in theſe Conjurations, that are uſed, as well for Divination, as Witchcraft, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that they are part of the Pagan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and even make it wholly up amongſt ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially in the <hi>Weſt-Indies, Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. And 'tis almoſt impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, ſince their whole Religion turns upon their Opinion of the Gods, or draws it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> They look by no means upon their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor the ſcope they aim at, as things evil of their own nature; but only by the bad uſe that is made of them, wherefore anciently, the <hi>Magi</hi> and Diviners, were found amongſt the King's Attendants, and in the Temples, as are ſtill at this day the <hi>Brainines,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Fetiſſeros</hi> in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> the <hi>Baivas or Piais</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and the Country of the <hi>Cannibals, &amp;c.</hi> and ſeveral others of the ſame quality, ſo that no body is acknowledg'd for Wiſe, Doctor, Prieſt, Prophet, nor becomes Councellor of State, unleſs he be Diviner or Magician, in the ſenſe that has been ſet down. <hi>The Holy Scripture</hi> ſhows the ſame in the perſons <hi>Jannes, Jambres, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, Daniel,</hi> and his Companions, of which we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59386:92"/>have ſaid ſomething before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1, 4. And it may be obſerved in the general inſtances that have been alledg'd, that the Heathens had publick Schools to teach thoſe Arts, that the Prieſts eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> We ſee at the ſame time, for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the entrails of ſacrificed Beaſts, and ſome Meat and dreſs'd Herbs, were imployed in their Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Divinations; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſomething divine was mix'd with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. 'Tis therefore certain, that all their practices were grounded upon a certain knowledge, and partly upon vain conjectures, and very great errors; for to ſeek the Deity and to fear it, is an effect of the natural knowledge of God, which Men keep in the midſt of their greateſt corruption. But to admit ſo many ſorts of Deities, of ſuch a low rank, and ſuch a contemptible Nature, and to ſerve him in ſo many different ways, is an effect of the corruption of the mind; which, let it be ſaid in reference to thoſe that acknowledge one God, or Spirit, and who believe the Immortality of the Soul, to which believe the Opinion of the <hi>Epicures</hi> is not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite thô they ſeem to deny both, or at leaſt, to call them in queſtion; for <hi>Epicure</hi> and his modern followers, deny not ſo much the exiſtence of a God and of Spirits, as they are earneſt to perſwade ſuch, as believe both, that their practices bely their Faith, and are not agreeable to their principles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis impoſſible that one ſhould be both an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> and a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> or a <hi>Diviner:</hi> And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, no Heathen ever endeavoured to contradict the Hypotheſes of <hi>Epicure,</hi> without admitting thoſe Arts and their effects.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. For a greater certainty, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to hear thoſe Philoſophers ſpeak in their own words. <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> has collected part of what they ſay, Sect. 11. Chap 6. <hi>'Tis the ſame thing that God ſhould govern the World by himſelf, as ſome affirm, or as others aſſert, by Miniſters generally call'd</hi> Genii, <hi>or</hi> Demons, <hi>for when all is done, things go nevertheleſs their uſual way in great part, as thô there were no ſuch Miniſters. And thô it were granted, that there are ſome, they could not be ſuch as they are fancyed,</hi> viz. <hi>of Human ſhape, and converſing with us, I will not ſay that being for the moſt part wicked they could not lead a long and happy life, becauſe malignity is joyned to Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and tends to ruin;</hi> That's what they ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirits, let us then ſpeak of what is practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that Account, <hi>They uſe to alledge Divination as a proof both of Providence and of the exiſtence of Spirits, but I look with ſorrow upon that Human weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſeeks for Oracles, even in Dreams, as thô God being ſet upon</hi> Stilts, <hi>came by frightful viſions to forewarn Men in their deepeſt Sleep, of what is to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to them; as thô fortune and chance were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce ſuch events, without mixing God, not only with the Sun and Moon, and ſeveral other kinds of Annimals, but alſo with all ſorts of Stone and Braſs.</hi> Thoſe that ſpeak ſo, make it evident, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have to deny the exiſtence of God and Spirits, than to acknowledge them ſuch as the other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens believed them, and to be obliged to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Sorcerers and Diviners, by granting, that they exiſt.

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> What are the Opinions of the Jews, and how neceſſary it is to examine them.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. WE have hitherto only conſidered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm,</hi> which has no other light but that of Nature; now we ſhall enquire, what thoſe that are illuminated with the light of the Holy Scripture, believe or practiſe upon that account, In the mean while, it muſt be obſerved, that they are not all of one ſenſe, being divided into <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which difference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the inequality of the light they have received, or made uſe of; I ſhall begin with thoſe that are at greateſt diſtance from Chriſtianity, and conſequently the neareſt to <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> It ſeems that the followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſhould have that place; ſo much the more, becauſe we have favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices on behalf of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as having Anciently been the People of God. But notwithſtanding what they have been, they are now ſo much degenerated, that the belief of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> may be ſaid to have more conformity with ours, then theirs hath, both deteſt Idolatry, and acknowledge one God, and take his word for the rule of their Faith. The <hi>Jews</hi> receive only the Old Teſtament, but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> admit alſo of the New, adding the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to correct and perfect them both. The <hi>Jews</hi> do almoſt the ſame as to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Addition of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which contains the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Ancient. But if the Opinions of both
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59386:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>parties were deeply ſearched into, perhaps it would be found that thoſe of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> favour more the infalibility of the Law and Goſpel, than thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that of the Law alone. Add to this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is acknowledged by the <hi>Mahometans</hi> for a great Prophet, and honoured in that quality, whereas he is horribly blaſphemed by the <hi>Jews.</hi> For theſe reaſons I ſay, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are halfe nearer to us, than the modern <hi>Jews.</hi> But what need we any farther proof, ſince as to this matter, it is plain that the <hi>Jews</hi> are leſs from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi> than the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as ſhall appear by the proof I ſhall produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. As long as we have had to do with <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> only, we needed but to make an inquiry after their Opinions concerning their Gods, the Spirits, and the Souls. But here the Queſtion is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the plurality of Gods, for thô formerly the <hi>Jews</hi> have been extraordinarily inclined to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they have now ſuch a great averſion for <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> ever ſince 2300 years, that they are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, that they will acknowledge but one Perſon in the Divine Unity. They believe, by the light of <hi>the Holy Writ,</hi> that this <hi>only God</hi> is Almighty, and ſufficient to himſelf, and to all things, which he has created of nothing and governs and maintains alone. Amongſt his Creatures they reckon Angels and Men, and think that the laſt have a Soul more excellent, than that of Bruits, tho' far inferior to the Angelical Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Such has been in all times the belief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo farr is more agreeable to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faith, then that of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. But the ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, whilſt the firſt Temple ſtood, muſt be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that into which it is inſenſibly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59386:94"/>fall'n. The <hi>Jews</hi> of that time were Orthodox, ſave only thoſe who ſuffer'd themſelves to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Idolatry, and undoubtedly they had no other Opinion of the Angels, Demons, and Souls of Men, but what the <hi>Holy Writings</hi> ſtill teach us; ſo that if we ſtill look upon them as different from us, it is becauſe we conſider thoſe of latter times, when their State was in its fall, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in its growth. But tho' they be now divided into two Sects, that of the <hi>Carraijim,</hi> who only follow the <hi>Holy Writ;</hi> and that of the <hi>Rabbanim,</hi> who adhere to the Traditions of their Doctors; there is yet but the latter, which deſerves to come into conſideration, the number of the former being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconſiderable, they being a remainder of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> which are hardly known in <hi>Europe,</hi> whereas, the other may be called the poſterity of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>

Tho' we deſign only to inſiſt upon the latter, yet a more particular difference may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved betwixt the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Modern.

That there are others, inferior in Dignity to the firſt, who take on Bodies, of which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by death, and into which ſome of them return.

Upon this difference of the <hi>Angels,</hi> in the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I think it better to propoſe what has been ſaid by the ſame Author, than to quote any other; becauſe there is none amongſt them, that may be compar'd to him, either for Learning or Judgment, as not intending to impute to them more fooliſh Doctrines, than thoſe that are admitted by their moſt authentick Writers. Thus then <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſſes this Opinion. <hi>When the Prophets ſay, that they have ſeen the Angels as a fire, and with wings, they ſpeak after the manner of the Prophets, and by a ſimile, deſigning only to ſhew, that they are neither corporeal nor heavy. In this ſenſe it is that God himſelf is called a Conſuming fire,</hi> viz. <hi>improperly thus, likewiſe this paſſage muſt be underſtood, he makes the Winds his Angels,</hi> or, as it is in ſome Translations, <hi>The Spirits,</hi> for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Not that they are placed one above the other, as it is done amongſt Men; but as we ordinarily ſay of two wiſe perſons, that one is wiſer than the other, and that the Cauſe is more excellent than the Effect.</hi> So that he pretends that God himſelf has produced

They have often appeared to the Prophets in an human ſhape; they dwell above the Coeleſtial Orbs, and are called the <hi>Army of Heaven.</hi> But the Devils, or <hi>Schediim,</hi> that are the wicked Angels, or as they uſe to ſpeak, <hi>Kacodaimones,</hi> the <hi>Bad Demons,</hi> of whom mention has been made, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. have their abode under the Moon, and are the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of God's Wrath and Judgments.

WE have examined the Opinions of the Jews upon that matter, as much as they differ from the holy writ; for as far as their belief is conſonant to it, we receive and approve of the ſame. Let's now ſee what they practiſe as to Witchcraft, the Holy Scripture may fully convince us of the great inclination that People ever had for it; which doubtleſs proceeded. <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the practices they had ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they had not abſtained, but had ſeen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of them in the Country they inhabited, that was ſurrounded and intermixed with ſo many Nations addicted to that Art. 'Tis for that Reaſon the Law gives them ſuch frequent warnings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, <hi>Exodus,</hi> 22, 18. <hi>Levit.</hi> Chap. 18. v. 31. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. v. 27. <hi>Deuter.</hi> Chap. 13, 8, 9, 14. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 6. v. 12.20.

That Sin became general in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the Kingdom of the 10 Tribes, ſo that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, that <hi>They uſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, and obſerved the cry of Birds, 2 Kings,</hi> Chap. 17. v. 17.

The writings of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that are full of Inſtructions for that purpoſe, and are nevertheleſs in great credit among them, give upon that ſubject a teſtimony not advantageous to them, eſpecially ſince, in the following times, they uſed the ſame Arts againſt <hi>Chriſtianity. Lightfoot</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That after the Deſtruction of their City and Temple, there were ſeveral Impoſtors amongſt tbem, who eagerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelves to Magick, by which they got after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into great reputation, and that the expounding of Dreams was a pretence they made uſe of, to commit a vaſt number of Deceits and Villanies.

However it will not be beſides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to add, what the ſame <hi>Lightfoot</hi> has gather'd from ſeveral of their writings, eſpecially from the Book <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> concerning their <hi>Bathkol</hi> or the <hi>Daughter of the Voice,</hi> which is the name the <hi>Jews</hi> gave to the <hi>Echo,</hi> pretending it was an Oracle, that under the Second Temple, ſupplyed the want of the <hi>

This is known by all that are but a little acquainted with the Jewiſh affairs, and have read ſome of their writings, but here are proofs that ſhow they made uſe of <hi>Bathkool</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations. <hi>Rabbi Jochanan</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to conſult <hi>Bathkool,</hi> to go and ſee <hi>Rabbi Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> they paſs'd before the School, and heard a Boy reading what is contained, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 25. verſe 1. <hi>Samuel is Dead.</hi> They obſerv'd that, and found that the <hi>Samuel</hi> they ſought was Dead.

But beſides thoſe ſingularities, we may take notice that all their Witchcraft is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two grounds, the influences of the Stars, and thy apparitions of Spirits, the reaſon of the former ground is, that thô they eſteem not the Celeſtial lights to be Gods; yet they aſcribe to them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular virtue, working upon, and influencing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Actions, as well external as internal ſenſes. We have already heard <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Ben. Maimon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that matter. 'Tis very uſual with them to ſay, <hi>The Planets make ſuch a one Wiſe, or Rich,</hi> as <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> relates it in his <hi>Lexicon Talmudicum,</hi> out of the Books of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> theſe are happy influences or Conſtellations, that are called <hi>Mazzal-toob,</hi> but <hi>Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal-ra</hi> is a malignant Star, under which one is born, or whoſe virtue influences him all his Life. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſays again upon the Authority of the ſame Book, <hi>That the Planet of the Day of ones Birth, influences him not, but only that of the Hour.</hi> And even, we find in that Book which is the <hi>Genius</hi> of every Man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Planet under which he's born, He who is born under the <hi>Sun,</hi> will be handſom, free, not diſſembling, but of an unconſtant humour. Under <hi>Venus,</hi> he'll be rich and letcherous. Under <hi>Mercury,</hi> skilful and of a good memory. Under the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſickly, and unſtedfaſt. Under <hi>Saturn,</hi> unfortunate. Under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> juſt; and Under <hi>Mars,</hi> happy. Which is the ſame with all the other Conſtellations. In the mean while it is commonly ſaid, <hi>That there is no Planet in</hi> Iſrael, becauſe all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeem to be born under one <hi>Planet,</hi> being all of the ſame Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Conduct; therefore we muſt conclude, that thoſe diſtinctions concern only ſtrangers, and that <hi>Iſrael</hi> has the skill of foretelling their good and bad Fortune. However they are much diſturb'd when the Moon is Eclipſed; becauſe they take that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as an ill preſage to them, which is an evident

The moſt skilful, flying from one corner of the World to the other, ſometimes learn what is to happen.</hi> For this Reaſon he acknowledges page 18. <hi>That ſeveral Conjure up thoſe Spirits, and do wonders by help of the black Art. We read even in ſome Cabbaliſtical Books, as in</hi> Pirke Chalos, <hi>and</hi> Ratſiel, <hi>and in ſome others, the names of thoſe Spirits, and the form of the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations uſed for that purpoſe,</hi> There are alſo to be found all the preſages that may be drawn from the various ſorts of Apparitions. If thoſe Sprits appear to a Man alone, they forebode nothing good; if they appear to two perſons together, they preſage nothing ill; but it never happens, that they ſhew themſelves to three in a company.</p>

When a Child comes into the World, the terrour of <hi>Lilis</hi> comes with him, to ſeize upon the Spirits of the Parents, becauſe that <hi>Lilis</hi> intends to kill the Boys, within 8 days of their birth, and the Girls within the 21th. The remedy of the German Jews, to preſerve themſelves from that danger, is, <hi>To draw circular lines with Chalk or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coles, upon the</hi> 4 <hi>Walls of the Chamber, wherein the Woman lies, and to write upon each Circle</hi> Adam, Eve, let Lilis be gone, <hi>they alſo write upon the Door of the Chamber the names of the three Angels that preſide over Phyſick, Senoi, Sanſenoi,</hi> and <hi>Saumangelof,</hi> as <hi>Lilis</hi> her ſelf taught them, when ſhe hoped to drown them all in the Sea. This is related by <hi>Elias</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>Thisbi,</hi> to which he gives no great credit, as he himſelf witneſſes. I cannot omit what <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſays in his <hi>Lexicon Talmudicum,</hi> concerning the weapons wherewith they arm themſelves againſt <hi>Phantoms. A Vail ſpread over the Face, hinders the</hi> Phantaſm <hi>from knowing him that is frighted, but if God judges that he deſerves to be terrified for his ſins, he cauſes the vizard to fall down, that the Ghoſt may ſee and bite him.</hi>

To this the choice of days is of great uſe, and they have ſo great a regard for them, that they do no longer deſerve the reproach, that was caſt upon them, of <hi>Not underſtanding the ſigns of times.</hi> The ſame <hi>Buxtorf, in his School of the Jews,</hi> will ſupply us with a ſpecimen of that Cuſtom, At the great day of propitiations, they appeaſe <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> with a preſent, for on that only day in the whole Year, he is allowed, by a compact with

The <hi>Firſt</hi> means they uſe for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is to blow upon the Corn, withall their ſtrength, from morning to night, fancying to make <hi>Sammael</hi> forget the quality of it, by the fright they caſt upon him. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Day of the Year is alſo fit to put another cheat upon him, for as on that day, God ſits in judgment for the examination of Sins, they endeavour to hinder their Enemy from bringing his accuſations againſt them, by concealing from him the date of the Day. The ſubtilty they uſe in that occaſion, is that they forbear to read, either the begining or the end of the Law, as <hi>Sammael</hi> ſuppoſes, that they ſhall do that Day, and thus they never fail to catch him. They alſo abſtain as much as they can on the 17th day of the Month <hi>Tammus,</hi> that anſwers to our <hi>June,</hi> and the 9th of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Month on which falls their Second faſt to go from home, and eſpecially avoid to make any jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of 4 or 5 Miles, or to appear in a Court of Juſtice, becauſe that time is the reign of a wicked Spirit call'd <hi>Ketelmeriri, bitter Deſtruction,</hi> a name drawn from <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 32. v. 24.

However, our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement will diminiſh, if we obſerve that all theſe Doctrines have been drawn from Paganiſm, and have been received amongſt them, only by an effect of the natural inclination and eagerneſs of that People, for ſuch Fables and Inventions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering, whether or no they were agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Rules of the Law.

And therefore, 'tis but reaſonable to uſe this circumſpection that knowing that ſort of People to be Men of ſenſe, as there are many in other Sects, we interpret their Fables only with relation to that, which is clearly and ſignificantly expreſs'd in other places, and in reference to the tendency they ſeem to have, in what is related of their other Opinions.</p>

Each has his particular Office, one watches over one Member, and th'other over another; one is ſo ſubſervient in this, and the other in that Affair. Amongſt all thoſe Angels, there are two who preſide over all the reſt, ſitting one on the Right, and th'other on the Left hand, and being call'd <hi>Kerim Kiatib,</hi> that is to ſay, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59386:109"/>Writers: That on the Right hand keeps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the good Actions, and that on the Left of the bad. They are ſo merciful that they ſpare him, if he commits any ſin before he falls aſleep, hoping he ſhall repent, if not, they ſet it down, but if he repents, they write, <hi>Eſtig fourillah,</hi> God forgive. They accompany him every where, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when he goes to the Neceſſary houſe, whither they let him go alone, waiting for him at the door where they again take poſſeſſion of him. For that reaſon, when the <hi>Turks</hi> go to that place, they go in with the Left Foot, and when they come out, they put the Right Foot foremoſt, that the Angel who ſets down their good Works, ſhould ſeize firſt upon them. <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf confirms that Fable, ſaying,</q>

But to that Witchcraft, little Children are required, for the great ones ſee nothing, whereas the others look into the Oyl, and being asked, whether they ſee the ſigns which the Devils make, they anſwer yes, which gives them great credit, and gets them plenty of Money.</hi> The <hi>Catoptromancy</hi> of the Ancients was ſomthing like that, Chap. 3.

For what Man naturally conceives, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways darkneſs, neither is the illumination which the <hi>Holy writ</hi> affords to the underſtanding, always effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; ſo that a Chriſtian, often better knows what he ought to know, then he does what he ought to do. This plainly appears, in that Man is readier to ſearch after the Truth by his reaſon, than to put it in practice by his Virtue. The cauſe of it is, that our natural curioſity that has contributed to the fall of our firſt Parents, has been ſince increaſed and ſtrengthned by the effect of the fall it ſelf; and that it drives us on ſo much the more to deſire to know much, as our underſtanding is become leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of true conceptions. But the corruption of Man allows him not to make ſuch Progreſſe. And therefore we muſt imagine, that whatever is practiced amongſt ſuch or ſuch People, eſpecially as to Religion, always and only proceeds from their belief and Doctrine. This will quickly be known to us, if we take the trouble of conſidering Chriſtianity, ſuch as it formerly was, and ſtill is at this preſent.</p>

I ſhall name ancient Chriſtianity the ſix firſt Centuries before the Pope and <hi>Mahomet</hi> aroſe: However, I ſhall not conſider it as it was eſtabliſh'd by our Lord and his Apoſtles, which will be done more conveniently hereafter, but with relation to the ſucceſſion of times: In the mean while a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtinction muſt be made between the Opinions of the Church, or of the Chief Doctors of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the Errors of thoſe ſhe has condemn'd. We muſt afterwards take notice of what certainty may be had both of the Practices and particular Senſe of thoſe that have been branded for Hereticks. For we pretend not to impute to Chriſtians what has been rejected by the generality of them, nor to charge the Hereticks with whatever is ſaid of their Errours. Now, one may, methinks, take for Opinions generally received in the Church, thoſe that have been taught by their Chief Doctors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contradicted by the others, as far as it appears by any Writing, though they muſt not for that be taken for Articles of Faith. And likewiſe, though the Hereticks ſhould have been charged, as to the Doctrine, with ſome Opinions they owned not, yet 'tis not conceiveable that they ſhould have been falſly accuſed of Acts of Magick, the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of which they did not ſo much as believe. After that Obſervation let's ſee what the moſt famous Chriſtians of the Primitive times have believed, as to Spirits and their Operations, and at the ſame time what they relate of other Sects and People.</p>

But we muſt examine thoſe that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59386:114"/>them from Age to Age, and ſee what was their Opinion upon thoſe two Points, without preſuming it was grounded upon Rule, or Eccleſiaſtical Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which appears not. And though thoſe two Points are of the higheſt conſequence, yet every one had ſtill liberty to expreſs his particular Opinions. However, for other Opinions of leſs conſequence, and I durſt almoſt ſay of nothing, Men have been dealt with as Hereticks, and the whole Chriſtian World muſt be call'd together to come to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And therefore I ſhall only make uſe here of ſuch Explications of the chief Doctors, as I have read my ſelf, which I ſhall endeavour to tranſlate faithfully, and word for word, as much as poſſible.</p>

Here are his own Words that ſeem very ſtrange. <hi>All Demons are ſo as that indeed they have nothing Carnal, but their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is Spiritual, and as a Fire and Light. The Nature of their Bodies can however be penetrated by none but ſuch as are endued with the Spirit of God.</hi> What he adds afterwards is more Conſonant to Reaſon, <hi>That the Demons are not the Souls of Men.</hi> He believes not however <hi>that Souls are ſimple Natures, but that they are compoſed of parts <gap reason="foreign">

But as to thoſe of Men, we hear the Doctors of that Age giving to the Demons a power over Bodies and Souls.

In his Apologetick,</hi> Chap. 20. he gives a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular explication of what he believes as to the Aſſaults made by Demons upon Soul and Body. He thinks, <hi>That having a very ſubtile and thin Eſſence, they are ſo much the apter to act in an inviſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible manner. He ſhows thereby, that he conceives created Spirits as the thineſt and ſubtileſt of all Bodies, and therefore explains his meaning by this Compariſon.

And indeed, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was not contented with the Fables of <hi>Origen,</hi> and other Doctors, of which mention has been made, but he admitted whatever had been propoſed hitherto as Doubts and Queſtions, which he paſſed into Determinations and Decrees: And, as tho' what had been maintained before had not been ſufficient, he thought fit to add ſomething of his own: So that ſince his time there were not only 9 Orders of Angels, but they knew alſo the Degrees of each, viz. <hi>Angels, Archangels, Virtue, Powers, Principalities, Dominions, Thrones, Cherubims,</hi> and <hi>Seraphims;</hi> as is to be found in his 34th Homily upon the Goſpels.

It muſt be obſerved that at that time the curioſity to know whither Souls went after Death, gave occaſion by degrees to invent Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; the diſcovery of which has been ſo far finiſhed amongſt the Papiſts, that they go now thither by thouſands. <hi>Boetius, a Roman Conſul,</hi> who lived about 63 years before the <hi>Pontificate of Gregory,</hi> begun, in his 4th <hi>Book, Proſa</hi> 4. to give ſome Notion of that place, by the Anſwer he makes to the following Queſtion. <hi>Does there in your Opinion remain no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the Soul after her ſeparation from the Body?</hi> To which he Anſwers: Yes doubtleſs, and even 'tis not a ſlight Pain; for I hold; that ſome Souls are very ſeverely puniſhed, whereas others are purified by Grace. As to <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, who from a Souldier became Pope, he blows heat and cold from the ſame Mouth, with as much ſicklineſs and levity as the Wind, againſt the Cuſtom of the Popes, who uſe to decide ſo poſitively and boldly. Upon the 7th Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> giving advice to a Sinner, he ſaith, <hi>That there is no human Eye (that is no Grace of the Redeemer) that caſts looks upon the Soul, after ſhe has laid off the Fleſh.</hi> And farther he adds; <hi>That when Holy or wicked Spirit receives at the point of Death, a Soul departing from her bodily Priſon, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for ever, and without hopes of any Change, in the hands of him that has taken her; ſo that when ſhe's once raiſed to Glory, ſhe can never fall again into Pain and Torments; whereas when ſhe is once caſt down into the Eternal Abyſs, ſhe can never come out of it:</hi> Upon the 10th Chapter he ſays again; <hi>He that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and deliver'd to puniſhment by reaſon of his Sins, and brought to the place of Execution, has no longer hopes of Mercy or Forgiveneſs.</hi> But this Pope does not always maintain this <hi>Theſis;</hi> for he ſpeaks thus in the 4th.

In the mean while, thoſe pains were not inflicted upon that ſort of people ſo much, becauſe, of their Cheats, as has been already ſaid; as eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by reaſon of their Crimes, and the hurt they were believed to procure to Men and Beaſts, by mixing and perturbating the Elements by their <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> which made them worthy of the moſt cruel puniſhments. This plainly appears by the 6th <hi>Law</hi> made by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Julian. Anno</hi> 357. <hi>There are ſeveral who are not afraid of confounding the

It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believed, that the Crime of that People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their converſe with the Spirits, whoſe Power and malice they made uſe of to torment other Men.

In the mean while he agrees with himſelf in this, that he believes ſorcerers converſe with the wicked Spirit, and that the Conjurations of the former, force the latter to ſay and do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from them; but that all the effects of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft are to be aſcribed to them, and not to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians.</p>

THE 11th Chapter of this Book was deſigned to compare together, the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices of the various Heathens, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits. The natural light that remained in our underſtanding, notwithſtanding the darkneſs in which it has been involv'd by Sin, has been able, without the help of the <hi>Holy writ,</hi> to diſcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Opinion and practices, were founded upon true, or falſe grounds. We have ſince heard, thoſe that acknowledge the Authority of the <hi>Holy writ,</hi> ſpeak very differently, by which means, the light of Reaſon may be encreaſed, and it's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption better'd. Let us now ſee what they have done as to this, and how far their endeavours have attained. To that end, we ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> conſider, wherein the latter differ from the Heathens, what they have retain'd of <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> and laſtly in what points they differ from each other; having always

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Theſe 3 ſorts of People, <hi>Jews, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> rejecting the plurality of Gods that were believed and adored by the Heathens, and Worſhiping one <hi>Only God,</hi> have overthrown what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the others had invented, concerning confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, inferior, and mean Gods, or familiar Spirits, that were born with Men and outlive them; and at the ſame time, have deſtroyed whatever Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Witchcrafts were grounded upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by which Men preſume to acquire ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, and produce ſome certain effects. We have found nothing like, amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> for thô they may have ſomthing that appears like it, yet 'tis quite different, as we ſhall ſhow hereafter. And as to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we ſee that they unanimouſly reject all theſe things, and look upon them as deluſions and impieties; and as to what the laſt, together with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> have retained of the Opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Heathens, it has been taken from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of this laſt Sect, and accommodated to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or gather'd from it by falſe explications.

Such are the Pains which <hi>the Devils of Torments</hi> inflict upon the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of <hi>Gilgul,</hi> or <hi>the Revolution of Souls,</hi> Chap. 12. Sect. 20.

However, thoſe that are not altogether remote from them, reject not wholly the Apparitions of the Souls ſeparated from their Bodies, nor their various Operations, to which <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> have traced out the way for them, as we have ſeen, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>S.</hi> 7.</p>

When we compare all theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we ſee the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> delivering their Opinions, as from hand to hand, to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſo that we eaſily perceive that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have by degrees, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, received the Opinions of the Heathens, by whom they were ſurrounded, amongſt whom they were mixed, and from whom the Chriſtians are deſcended: And that the laſt have alſo borrowed much from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have delivered to them the Sacred Writings, with moſt of their particular Interpretations, that have been greedily ſwallow'd down, and ſince increaſed to a great exceſs. As to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> whoſe Law is a mixture of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrines, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of what is evil in them all than of what is good; and therefore ſtored with more Errors than Truth; It is not ſtrange they ſhould have ſo much agreement with thoſe of the Nations we ſpeak of.

IF it were abſolutely requiſite to know the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the ancient Hereticks, at leaſt of thoſe that are call'd ſo, we would be at the ſame Pains as thoſe that endeavour to diſcover them: For their own Books that were then condemned, being loſt, 'tis not reaſonable blindly to believe whatever their Adverſaries ſay of them, whoſe Zeal for the Truth was often mixed with human Paſſions: So that they may ſometimes impute to their Antagoniſts Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were not ſo bad as they gave out, either miſunderſtanding or wreſting them. Perhaps St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> has increaſed the number of Hereſies to a hundred, for fear he ſhould diminish that of ſeventy which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had before eſtablished in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and 57th Chapter of the <hi>Hereſies.</hi> For if <hi>Celſus</hi> could mark, in the moſt remote Antiquity, and from the firſt times that we have any knowledge of Books, but 100 principal Doctors of Heatheniſm, each of whom made not a particular Sect, but only followed the footſteps of his Predeceſſors; how can it be imagin'd that Chriſtianity, that has the Word of God for it's Rule, ſhould have been in much leſs time more divided than Paganiſm, that was founded on ſuch weak and uncertain Grounds.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> it ſeems ſhould be chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, as to the Doctrine of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> ſince he himſelf had been infected with their poiſon, and has particularly treated of that matter in his 46 <hi>Ch. of the Hereſies;</hi> however, I ſhall do it with great caution, by the Reaſons juſt now alledged: beſides that theſe words of his Preface, <hi>Ad quod vult Deum,</hi> made him extreamly ſuſpected; for he ſays, that in his little Book of <hi>Hereſies,</hi> he ſhows a way, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde poſſit omnis haereſis, &amp; quae nota eſt, &amp; quae ignota vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri. To avoid all Hereſies, whether known or unknown.</hi> For how can one provide himſelf againſt what is unknown, and conſequently ſignifies nothing? nay, I may boldly ſay, that what is unknown cannot be called Hereſy, ſince whatever deſerves that name, muſt be known; or perhaps St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> meaning muſt be underſtood in this ſenſe; that diſcovering the nature and Genius of ſuch Hereſies, as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known, he has furnished us with light, and weapons againſt thoſe that are yet unknown, but may become manifeſt hereafter. However this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the place to inſiſt longer upon this Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall return to our ſubject. The ſame Father in his Book againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi> imputes to them ſome things, <hi>Quantumlibet negent ad ſe pertinere. Thô they deny them ever ſo much.</hi> But as he treats not diſtinctly enough of all their Opinions, eſpecially thoſe that belong to our deſign, I ſhall rather follow <hi>Danaeus,</hi> who has gathered the chief points of their belief, as well out of the Book of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> before quoted, and the reſt of his works, as out of many other Authors, from whom I ſhall only relate what may be ſubſervient to our ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. As to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Spirits,</hi> they are ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> To have eſtabliſhed two principles, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to each other, one of which was good, and the Author and Original of all good; and the other
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59386:133"/>bad, the Author of all Evil, and the Prince of darkneſs. That the firſt as they ſay, is the God that has formed all things, and that the other is</hi> Hyle, <hi>that is the matter from which all things have been formed, and which is eſteem'd by them to be the</hi> Devil. <hi>Some diſtinguiſh the</hi> Devil <hi>from the</hi> Prince of darkneſs, <hi>and tranſlate not as we do the laſt words of the</hi> 44th v. of the 8th Ch. of St. John. He is the Father of lies; <hi>but his</hi> Father is a lie, <hi>namely</hi> the Father of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Second. <hi>As to the good God, they ſay, that his Eſſence is diſperſed as by portions, through all the Creatures, and inherent to them, which they explain by many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commentaries.</hi> This is what they think of God and the Devil, in relation to their Eſſence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, what follows concerns their Operations.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. Third. <hi>The People of darkneſs formerly warr'd with the People of light. The good God went himſelf to attack, the Prince of darkneſs, by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principal Spirits, which he had produced of his own Eſſence, who however, being too weak, were taken Priſoners; but</hi> Chriſt <hi>came to repair that diſorder, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been begotten by ſome certain firſt Man, who had been the promoter of this War, and had begun it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourth. <hi>That in the mean while,</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf is the Serpent that ſeduced</hi> Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>Fifth. <hi>That Chriſt is now fixed amongſt the Stars, eſpecially, in the luminous Globe of the</hi> Sun, <hi>in which ſenſe they explain his Aſcenſion to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 5. Sixth. <hi>They believe the</hi> Metempſychoſis <hi>in this manner; That the Souls ſhall paſs into the bodies of ſuch a kind of living Creatures, as they have moſt loved or abuſed, during their Life. He that has killed a mouſe or a fly, ſhall paſs in puniſhment, into the body of a mouſe or a fly, the ſtate in which he ſhall be put after death, ſhall likewiſe be oppoſed to that, in which he was during his Life. He that is rich ſhall be poor, and he that is poor ſhall be rich.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh. They alſo give two Souls to every Man, one of which, is always contrary to the other.</hi> But enough of their Doctrines, we leave the reſt to <hi>Danaeus,</hi> who aſcribes to them 21 in all, becauſe what he and other Authors ſay, belongs not to our ſubject.</p>

However I am not apt to aſſert, that they have believed and taught ſuch groſs Doctrines, as are imputed to them, and have been now relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For ſuppoſing the common Opinion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that they were chiefly extracted from the Philoſophy of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> (ſince <hi>Manes,</hi> their Firſt Author, was undoubtedly a <hi>Perſian,</hi>) and that they are ſtrangely mingled with the <hi>Chriſtian Divinity;</hi> It is unreaſonable to have the ſame Opinion of that People, that we have of other Nations, who never cultivated the ſtudy of Nature and Human learning; ſuch as thoſe we have met with in the Northern parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Southern of <hi>America.</hi> It may well be, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> aſcribe to the whole <hi>

Suppoſing they have eſtabliſhed two principal cauſes, one of good and the other of evil; but yet, ſo as that the Firſt is unconteſtably ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Second, as much as light is above dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the workman above the matter he works upon; 'tis probable, that they had an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as a Soul infuſed through the whole <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> that conſider'd by them as the body, in which that Firſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59386:134"/>cauſe continually operates. And as the contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corporeal paſſions riſe againſt the Empire of Reaſon that ought to govern them, ſo they might believe, that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> proceeding from <hi>matter,</hi> perpetually rebel againſt <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Fountain of all Reaſon.</hi> Whence it would follow, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould not be more abſolute maſter of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> than Man is of his body; thence has proceeded that <hi>Idea</hi> of two different Gods, one good, and the other bad; the latter being ſtill inferior to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who is indeed the workman, but has not an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government, there being a power in the World, ſo great, that it is able to reſiſt him.</p>

But whether I have made a juſt conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or whether the <hi>Manichees</hi> had other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then thoſe I imagine; it ſeems nevertheleſs, that I may reaſonable ſuppoſe it, upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Opinions ſo groſs as thoſe that are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them; not only are not admitted, but not ſo much as moved or propounded, as we ſhall ſee very ſoon in the ſeries of this work; becauſe the principal points of thoſe ſorts of belief with their dependencies, have a great relation with my Second and Third Book, as I hope to ſhow at the end of the Second. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether any one treats of the Devil and Spirits according to the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he only follows his own ſenſe and right, it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> aſſured, that all his Reaſonings will turn upon this notion of his; that God and the Devil have each an Empire, one contrary to the other, and that thô the Devil be ſubject to the power of God; yet his Empire is more apparent. It is denyed, that God now works any miracles, but ſome are raſhly aſcribed to the Devil, that ſurpaſs all thoſe that are mentioned in the <hi>Holy writ.</hi> We believe that there are Angels, and gather from the Holy Scripture, that they encamp about the faithful, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59386:134"/>the Devil likewiſe is inceſſantly active to do them hurt, if poſſible he can, but his abode is in Hell. However it is very rare to hear any one ſay, he has ſeen an Angel in a viſion, whereas the Devil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears almoſt continually. If any thing has been either ſignified or foretold, we never believe it to be the Operation of an Angel, but of the Devil: one is poſſeſt by him, and another bewitch'd; by his means, unknown Tongues are ſpoken, ſtrange things are ſaid, others no leſs wonderful are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and the moſt hidden ſecrets diſcover'd. But you will ſcarce meet with any that has ſo good Opinion of the power of an Angel; if we have any Holy thought, or good inſpiration, how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſoever it may be, we aſcribe it to the Holy Ghoſt, and ſeem not to believe, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſo much as capable of contributing to it; ſince it ne'er comes in our mind to think upon them. But the Devil penetrates the moſt ſecret thoughts of Men, overthrows their beſt deſigns, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly excites them to Evil, if they are accuſed and convicted of any crime, the excuſe is always at hand, for the Devil has done it, or at leaſt has tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo to do.</p>

And therefore ſince neither the Ancient Heathens nor the moderns; neither the Jews, the Mahometans, nor the Firſt Chriſtians, ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any ſuch Opinions; and that 'tis manifeſt, they have a greater relation with thoſe of <hi>Manes,</hi> I cannot but believe that this Doctrine which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſpring up in the <hi>Third Century,</hi> was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly oppoſed on all ſides by Orthodox Doctors, but yet ſpread very far into <hi>Aſia,</hi> whence it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed into <hi>Europe,</hi> it has maintained it ſelf there longer then 'tis believed.

'TIS now time to approach nearer our Age, and <hi>Firſt</hi> to conſider the Papiſts, and then our ſelves; for we now know, that the chief points of the doctrines to be examined, have Anciently made part of the religion of the Heathens, Jews, and Mahometans, and even have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Firſt Chriſtians, whoſe purity is ſo much commended. Afterwards, it was eaſy to obſerve in the laſt Chapter where we ſpake of the Manichees, that great part of the Doctrines aſcribed to them, have inſenſibly been introduced into the Chriſtianity of latter Ages.

For having himſelf uſurped a great Authority over the Churches of the Weſt, it was no hard matter, for him, to let his own imaginations and vain, inſtitutions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and to tranſmit them to his ſucceſſors. Since

Thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations were ſubſtituted inſtead of Reaſon; and when they needed writings to maintain them, thoſe of the Firſt Doctors of the Church were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand, which gave too fair a pretence, of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting whatever had been invented; for how ſtrange ſoever thoſe new Doctrines appeared, yet they were eaſily ſwallow'd down, provided they were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either in the writings of thoſe Doctors, or in others that were ſpurious and forged at pleaſure, and falſly aſcribed to them, if they were but declared authentick by the <hi>See of Rome.</hi> It happened with this matter as with all others, in which ſome change in the Worſhip and Doctrine, has inſenſibly been made, or ſomthing new introduced, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church till the beginning of the latter Age, when part of the Weſt was reformed, and re-eſtabliſhed in it's firſt ſtate.</p>

We muſt now conſider two things, <hi>viz.</hi> how far Popery has brought, in proceſs of time, it's unlawful Opinions; and then how far proceeded the rejection made by thoſe that reformed themſelves as to the Doctrine and Worſhip. For this reaſon, I ſhall ſpeak in this Chapter of what the Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon the ſubject I treat of, and ſhall relate their Worſhip and practices in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I intend not to gather thoſe Opinions from, the decrees of the <hi>Popes,</hi> nor the Canons of their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>

So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall alledge, being generally received for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, by thoſe of that Communion; they will have no reaſon to complain of, or exclaim againſt this method, ſince in the following Chapter, I ſhall ſhow, that thoſe manifold Opinions aſcribed to them, are confirmed by the proof of a general practice. But if I was to read over all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to extract their Opinions, it would prove too long and tedious a task; and therefore I ſhall only follow one of their writers, who is fallen into my hands by chance, becauſe he has read all the others, and extracted from them whatever is ſubſervient to our ſubject, having put it in order, without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing, as thô he had done it on purpoſe: ſince therefore, not only he is not of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and a Jeſuit too, I think the choice I have made, will not be blamed. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is <hi>Gaſpar Schottus,</hi> who is ſufficiently known by the learned writings he has publiſhed of late, and which he is not afraid to expoſe to our cenſure, ſince in 1662, he dedicated his <hi>Phyſica curioſa,</hi> to the <hi>Elector Palatine, Charles Lewis</hi> of glorious memory, who was of our Communion: this Book and another entituled, <hi>Magia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis,</hi> or <hi>

                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59386:136"/>and <hi>Devils,</hi> and afterwards touching human Souls, either in this Life or after Death. However, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not to make an abſtract of whatever they ſay, but only to illuſtrate the matter in hand, in order to prove what I have aſſerted. To that end I diſtinguiſh again the Angels into good and bad, to examine what concerns either of thoſe two ſorts.

               <p n="3">3. They are as well as the Angels divided into ſeveral Orders: But the Papiſts agree not together upon this matter; neither our Author, nor <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who has treated at large of this matter, agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor with others; but after all, I relate here what is moſt generally received; to which I add, that the Opinion of <hi>Thyleus,</hi> who divides the Devils into three Spiritual Dominions, and nine Quires, is not rejected, <hi>pag.</hi> 36, 37.</p>
               <p>

Their Power and Effects have always been much exalted amongſt the Papiſts; They hold for certain, that the wicked Spirits can do great wonders; either by their Knowledge or Power. <hi>Mira hoc loco vocamus,</hi> (ſays <hi>Schottus</hi>) <hi>quorum cauſas etiam ſapientes ignorant, &amp; digna admiratione cenſent, ſive de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>That the Devils can produce Effects that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the power of Nature:</hi> For though he declares afterwards, <hi>That they produce, but apparently and not really, ſome Effects that are peculiar to God only;</hi> yet he believes that frequently they really operate others, which indeed are not proper to God, but which neither Men nor the ordinary courſe of Nature are capable of effecting without the aſſiſtance of thoſe Spirits. To prove this <hi>Theſis,</hi> he quotes many Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Authors, and ſhows that they are all of the ſame Opinion.

               <p n="1">1. They alledge 15 ſorts of their Operations by their Motion from one place to another, of which the five firſt conſiſt in real Operations, and the nine laſt, in meer Repreſentations.

               <p n="1">1. They render viſible things inviſible, by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſnatching them from the ſight of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59386:138"/>2. They make Statues, and other inanimate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects move and walk.</p>

The 2d ſort of Diabolical Operations is no leſs credited; it conſiſting in the active virtue of Natural things; and therefore 'tis believed, that by the power of the Devil, whether he acts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and by himſelf, or by Wizards and Witches; Herbs, Fruits, Waters, and moſt other matters may be mixed in ſome ſort and degree, and with the proportions requiſite for it, whereby Food, Drink, Phyſick, or ſome other potion may be made up, that ſhall cauſe a great deal of hurt to Man and Beaſt.

For 'tis not doubted but the Devil can do whatever is poſſible to be done by natural means and which may happen in proceſs of time, by the ordinary courſe of nature, without the cooperation of that wicked Spirit, as we ſhall ſay anon, but he has this power by God's permiſſion, to imploy all the forces of nature, for the producing of what effect he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; whence often proceeds, that Men either by ignorance, or becauſe ſome extraordinary objects and events come before them, believe things that are not in being, or perſwade themſelves, that the Devil performs ſome certain effects that are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, In the mean while it remains conſtant and undoubted, that the Devil has power to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been already mentioned, as alſo whatever I am going to ſay.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Illuſions are made by the change of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when one thing is ſubſtituted inſtead of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that has been ſuddenly and impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſnatched away; or when an object is preſented to the Eyes, in ſuch a ſtate and manner as that, it produces a falſe viſion; or when any object made up of Air, or of ſome other Element, offers it ſelf to the ſight; or laſtly when there appears any thing compoſed of different matters, mingled together; ſo skilfully prepared, that what exiſted before, receives thereby another form and figure.</p>

After which it is certain, that three parts of the People believe and are firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that thoſe who knew any thing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and have not gone in time to reveal it to the Rector, or other Prieſt commiſſion'd by the Biſhop, never fail to fall into the poſſeſſion of the Devil, to whom the <hi>Monitory</hi> delivers them, after it's being thunder'd out, and that the Devil transforms them moſt, or all the Nights, into Dogs, Cats, Wolves, Goats, and other Animals, which is called to whurry as a Wolf. If one meet in the night ſome Wild-Beaſt or a Domeſtick ſtraying, he fancies to have met the Wolf-man, and is ready to ſwear it. Some of the moſt thinking and leſs ſuperſtitious part, at leaſt believe that the Excommunication contained in thoſe <hi>Monitories,</hi> cuts off from the Communion of their Church, and delivers to the Demons thoſe that have not ſubmitted to it, by revealing ſuch things, as 'tis often very convenient and uſeful to conceal.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. IN ſpeaking of this laſt kind of Demons we are deſcended by degrees, even to Specters and Phantaſms. But Firſt, we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there were yet two things to treat of, touching Spirits, that is, their Apparitions to Men, and their Operations in the ſame. It is upon this ſubject of Apparitions, that there is room to ſpeak of Phantaſms; which, according to the opinion of the Papiſts, are good and bad Angels, or Souls of the deceaſed, which become viſible, or which are underſtood without being ſeen; either that they ſpeak intelligibly, or that they make only ſome ſound and noiſe. There is yet this difference in their Apparitions, that there are ſome Souls, which whether they manifeſt themſelves viſibly, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are only heard, work ſome effects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are others, that operate nothing. <hi>Schottus</hi> freely teaches us many things, which relates to them, that is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> in what places Specters chiefly uſed to appear; <hi>Secondly,</hi> what Specters and Phantaſms are; <hi>Thirdly</hi> what they act; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to whom they particularly appear; <hi>Fifthly,</hi> what means there are to avoid them, and be rid of them.</p>

Sometimes they are good Angels but moſt frequently evil Spirits, Souls of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.

And they ſeem rather to have a deſign to tire them, than to give them any diſpleaſure. But it is alſo known, there are others ſo evil and ſo cruel, that it does not ſatisfie them to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment People, and cruelly to tear them where they come,</hi> (this ought to be underſtood of the poſſeſſed) <hi>But they will attack thoſe who paſs by, altho' at the ſame time they are a great way off, and horribly treat them.</hi> See one that ſays he knows them very well himſelf; and further, that no body is ignorant of it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes upon his own perſwaſion, and does applaud himſelf for it. Would it not be more miſchievous than the <hi>Will with a wisp</hi> himſelf, that ſets upon paſſengers to ſuſpect and confute his belief? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he is but a little while to be quiet, for we
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59386:144"/>cannot avoid troubling him, and ſhewing his Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> The Souls of the deceaſed are either ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or damned, it is held for certain, that thoſe that are happy, are often ſeen to appear to holy Men for their good, and that they appear ſtill. The Legends contain an infinite number of examples, which have been compiled from all ſorts of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, even of thoſe which are the leaſt worthy of credit, and that are enriched with a great many new ornaments that have been lent them in compiling of the work. But there are none which appear ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remark as theſe apparitions of Souls, which happen in conſequence of Covenants, that have been made betwixt Holy People in their life time, that is, when two or more have mutually promiſed, that who ſhould die firſt, ſhould appear to the other, and come and tell him news of the eſtate he was in, whether in Purgatory or in Heaven. The Author makes no doubt, but the thing happens as it is agreeds; but he dares not decide, whether ſuch an agreement be lawful, in which caſe he believes, it muſt be made by a particular inſpiration from God, <hi>p.</hi> 333.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. There is no more doubt of the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Souls that are damned, and they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon proofs of the ſame certainty, as the former. <hi>Schottus</hi> reports an example drawn from <hi>Bencius</hi> and <hi>Delrio,</hi> which appears ſo ſtrong and convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he expreſſes himſelf thus at the end. <hi>It is a ſtory which is confirmed by the belief generally given to it, it is publickly in all places, by many Books, and by a great number of letters, and the thing has happened in the time and place mentioned.</hi> It is a Queſtion to know, if any thing may not be falſe or mixed with any falſity, becauſe it has been publiſhed a long time without being contradicted, either in word or
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59386:144"/>writing? but it would be too long to treat upon this Queſtion here, it will be proper in another place. However, if this Hiſtory be true, it might confirm the ſentiments of the Papiſts, which ſay, That the Souls of the damned appear here upon Earth to the living, to preſent to them, in a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, the torments they ſuffer in Hell, to the end, they may bring them by that, to repent and leave off Sinning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Our Jeſuit is too wiſe to ſpeak much himſelf of Purgatory, he leaves that to others; he held nevertheleſs with thoſe of his Faith, <hi>That the Souls of the deceaſed deſire often of the living, the help of their Prayers and good works, and that by conſequence, the Souls in whatſoever place they may be, expect thoſe that are entred into Heaven, or into Hell, appear to Men, p.</hi> 253. We ſee that he will not much trouble us with Purgatory, and inſtead of perplexing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a determin'd place, he chooſes rather to be at large, in placeing Souls <hi>in loco diſpenſationis, in a place of diſpenſation;</hi> ſuch as the Schoolmen have forged it, whoſe Opinion, ſome of ours find not condemnable, in what place ſoever thoſe Souls may be, the Papiſts believe certainly, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear often to Men, to the ends that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. It is alſo the common Opinion, that the greateſt part of the Souls, are not thoſe that are in Paradiſe or in Hell; but thoſe that dwel between thoſe two places, or in Purgatory; for frequent jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from Heaven to Earth would too much diſturb the repoſe of the Souls, that are there; and Hell keep its Captives too cloſely confin'd, to give them ſo much liberty; and if it be permitted me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the publick, I ſhall ſay, it would bring no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Churches Coffers, whoſe fire of Purgatory makes the pot boyl much better, then all the flames of Hell do, or all the heat of the Celeſtial fire.</p>

It is likewiſe neceſſary to know that which is written <hi>Concerning the figure of bodies, in which Phantaſms appear,</hi> he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 287. <hi>That the Abbot</hi> Trithemeus, Thyreus, Delrius, and others, (whence it apperrs, that it is the common Opinion,) relate, <hi>Certain ſigns, by which one may know, if whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirits who preſent themſelves in a corporeal form, are Angels or Men, good Angels or Devils; Souls of the bleſſed or damned; or Souls which are in Purgatory to be purified there.</hi> However, he affords not a very ample inſtruction upon this point, for the chief mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he ſays of it, is, That the Souls of the bleſſed appear with an Air of content and joy; that the Souls which are in Purgatory have a more doleful countenance; but that thoſe of the damned, have a more frightful aſpect with ſigns of deſpair. And thô it be the common Opinion, that there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome defects, or ſomething disfigured in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59386:145"/>in which the Devil preſents himſelf; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, neither our Jeſuit, nor <hi>Delrius,</hi> holds it for certain; ſee that which the firſt puts for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and as generally believed, <hi>p.</hi> 291. It is that when the Devil appears and ſpeaks, he always ſpeaks the language of the Country where he is, ſo that he muſt underſtand more languages than <hi>Mithridates;</hi> or every Devil can appear but in his proper Country. But the voice of a Specter is always perplex'd, trembling, weak, and as mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as thô it were underſtood through a Tub, or through the cheft of an Earthen Veſſel, for ſays Schottus, <hi>The Devil can ſpeak no better.</hi> See accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Author, and thoſe of his belief, a good mark to know him.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59386:146"/>and to thoſe which belong to them, in any manner whatſoever, then they do to Strangers, becauſe that they hope for ſuccor from them, which they cannot hope from others. The Souls of the damned appear particularly to thoſe which have been the cauſe of their loſs, and of the torments they ſuffer.</hi> The apparitions of Devils are made alſo with reference to the ruins of thoſe they perſecute, and their ill will for Mankind, whom they take pleaſure to torment.

That which happens to the poſſeſt, gives occaſion to know more particularly what the Devil can act, <hi>Poſſeſſing,</hi> ſays <hi>Schottus, is an inevitable torment to Man from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which is in his body, who acts there, and keeps him in his power for a certain time. p.</hi> 521. Which he unfolds more particularly afterwards, but as there has been lately publiſhed, an Hiſtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun,</hi> and of a poſſeſſion very famous, ſaid to have happened in the Town, the circumſtances of which, give a great deal of light upon this point, we will alledge that which will be proper for this ſubject, referring a more ſtrict examination to our 4th Book, which we ſhall not be afraid to do, nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Author appears to be a Proteſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the moſt part of the ſtories this Hiſtory contains, are gathered from many Eccleſiaſtick Books, where they are grounded upon Authentick publick acts; and that the poſſeſſion was declared true by a decree of the Biſhop. It was alſo confirm'd by the blood of a Prieſt, who was executed for a Magician, after having been condemn'd by an act made by a ſentence of Judges Commiſſioner ſent by the French
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59386:146"/>King, to examine this affair, ſee then yet what <hi>Schottus</hi> ſays. <hi>p.</hi> 533. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> That a Man may be poſſeſt by all ſorts of evil Spirits, of what order ſoever they may be, for it has been ſaid in the 19th <hi>Ch. Sect.</hi> 8. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are divided into different orders, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Devils of <hi>Loudun,</hi> ſhews us, that one <hi>Elizabeth Blancheard,</hi> ſaid to be poſſeſt by ſix De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; by <hi>Aſtaroh</hi> and the coal of uncleanneſs, by the order of Angels; by <hi>Belzebub</hi> and the Lion of Hell, of the order of Archangels; by <hi>Perou</hi> and <hi>Marou,</hi> of the order of Cherubins. <hi>p.</hi> 255.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That all perſons of what Sex, Age, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or Religion ſoever they may be, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind of life they lead, either good or bad, may be poſſeſt by Devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> Althô the moſt part are poſſeſt without their conſent, and in ſpight of them, by evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it is believed, ſometimes, that there are ſome which conſent to it, there are thoſe to whom are attributed Spirits of <hi>Pithon,</hi> who divine by means of the Devil. <hi>Schottus p.</hi> 550.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. This Author explains to us more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, in what manner the Devil enters into Men, and how he works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> Granting he can cloath all ſorts of bodies as he pleaſes, and according as God permits him, he can ſometimes go and come, enter into Man, and come out inviſibly, and ſometimes, alſo viſibly and under the figures of ſmall Beaſts, or inſects, as Ants, Flies, Spiders, or under thoſe little birds. This is the common Opinions of Popiſh writers, althô <hi>Schottus</hi> is not very much for it. <hi>p.</hi> 539. But he is in the wrong, for here's a proof, at leaſt, as to his inviſible going in, and coming out, in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Devils of</hi> Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun; where it is ſaid, that a Devil called <hi>Bihemot,</hi> being gone out to ſeek a new Covenant, the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59386:147"/>Angel of the Nun that he poſſeſt, ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and bound him for a Month, under the Picture of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Church. <hi>p.</hi> 405. And that this Religious fancyed, as tho I know not what ſhould have gone out from her head, which remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her, as the Devil retired farther; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Devil himſelf declared, that after having been tied in his body not to part from it, he had at preſent, as well as his companions, the liberty of coming too and fro. <hi>p.</hi> 408.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second. Schottus</hi> howevever agrees, that evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits give to the poſſeſt, the faculty of ſpeaking ſtrange languages that they never learned, and of revealing ſecrets, which they could not know of themſelves. <hi>p.</hi> 540. So it is that the Nun of <hi>Loudun</hi> ſpoke La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin the beſt he could, aſſuring that ſhe had never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. <hi>Hiſtory of the Devils of</hi> Loudun. And ſo it is that the Demons diſcovered to the Jeſuit <hi>surin,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret matters, in his thought or in his perſon. <hi>p.</hi> 273. or that they went to kiſs the right hand of one of the exorciſts, for that the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> had ſo deſired it, and had declared his deſire to another exorciſt. <hi>p.</hi> 297. Upon which one of them hath writ, that the Devils anſwered often to interrogatories, made to them by the exorciſts, without expreſſing them otherwiſe then by the inferior direction of their thoughts. <hi>p.</hi> 104. See there the laſt effort of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to divine thoughts hidden, and in no ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third. Schottus</hi> ſays in other places, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal operations of the Devil, are made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the poſſeſt, and that they art little or nothing upon the Soul; and that for this reaſon, they cannot make a Man looſe his Faith, nor Hope, nor Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>p.</hi> 534. But the Devil <hi>Iſaacarum</hi> who knew more of it then our Author, ſays, that <hi>Behemet</hi> had not only vex'd <hi>Job</hi> in his body, but that he had alſo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59386:147"/>troubled his Soul: and that it is for this reaſon, that he ſinned not <hi>in all that he ſaid: Hiſtory of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of</hi> Loudun. Pag. 374.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. See what the Devil can do, and what he does very often, according to the opinions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks;</hi> be it that he makes uſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Men in theſe occaſions, or that he uſes them nor; thoſe that he imployes in his Miniſtry, are called Sorcerers, Enchanters, and Magicians. 'Tis ſtedfaſtly believed, that thoſe People have given themſelves to the Devil, and have covenanted with him, and ſigned it with their own Blood; That the Devil on his part is obſerved to do all they deſire during the courſe of their life, and that the Magicians on their part give themſelves to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and put themſelves into his poſſeſſion all their days, or for a certain time that they have mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed together. If you would ſee an example very particular of ſuch a contract, you need but read the Hiſtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun, Pag.</hi> 271. but you cannot read it without being amazed. The Magicians, in conſequence of their Covenants, are to enjoy a great deal of pleaſure, which will be procured to them by the Devil, to do a great deal of miſchief to others, and cauſe a great deal of damage to their Cattle, and to their other Goods. Their pleaſure conſiſts in ſolemn Aſſemblies, which are held in the night in places the Devil appoints, and where he appears in all ſorts of Figures: there they dance, drink and eat in exceſs, and the Men and Women mix themſelves carnally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with the Devil himſelf, who for that purpoſe, ſometimes transforms himſelf into a Man, ſometimes into a Woman. The Wizards and Witches are tranſported thro the' Windows, to places where they aſſemble, by virtue of a certain Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they anoint themſelves with; they ride
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59386:148"/>mounted upon the Devil, as upon a Horſe, for he is obliged to ſerve them; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he transforms himſelf into a Goat, or ſome other Animal. Sometimes there are in thoſe Aſſemblies, ſtrange Sacrifices, for the Hiſtory of the Devils of <hi>Loudun</hi> writes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 153. That they force the Devil Leviathan to ſurrender a Contract written upon the fleſh of the Heart of an Infant, taken in a <hi>Sabbat,</hi> held at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and of the Aſhes of a burnt <hi>Hoſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. The diſorders that they cauſe to Men, are to miſchief their perſons, or their Cattle, to ſtir up Tempeſts, to ſpoil the Corn of the field, to breed Diſputes, to diſturb the Society of Men, by a thouſand means; ſome times they do good with an eye to proper advantage; for ſome Money they diſcover things loſt; they declare if one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, or if not, and by whom it has been; they teach what muſt be done to cure them that are ſo, or they cure them themſelves. Of this, <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Book, intituled <hi>Daemonamania</hi> ſhall fully inſtruct, the reader, that will take the pains to read him. For no Authors are more large upon that ſubject, than he and <hi>Delrio.</hi> In the mean while we will look into their Sentiments, related by <hi>Schotus,</hi> more plainly than in their own Books.</p>

Mag. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe. Pag.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Proleg. Chap.</hi> 7. he eſtabliſhes theſe ſorts of Covenants as certain, diſtinguiſhing them into two kinds; thoſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59386:148"/>which are made expreſly with intention, and of deliberated purpoſe; And thoſe which are tacitely made. But we ſhall hereafter hear <hi>Sennertus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining himſelf more at large upon this ſubject. However, we find in the ſame place, as well as in <hi>Schotus</hi>'s Books this Maxime eſtabliſhed as certain, <hi>Quod Magicae hujus vis omnis nititur pacto, vel tacite vel expreſſo cum Demone, ut probat Delrius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That all the force of this Magick, depends on an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement made tacitely or expreſly with the Devil, as</hi> Delrius <hi>proves it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. This Author ſays further, <hi>That from the conſideration of the ends the Magicians have,</hi> viz. <hi>to act marvelous things by the Devils power, chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed three ſorts of Witchcraft; for they have ſometimes, no other end but to acquire the Art and Induſtry of producing miraculous effects for their proper advantage or pleaſure; or that of others: they ſometimes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſcover things to come, or to know things paſt, and ſuch preſent at are ſecret and hidden, and cannot be diſcovered by any human power; ſometimes they have no other end but to acquire the Power, the Art, and the Means to hurt Men.</hi> This is not the place to tell what the Papiſts believe Magicians are able to do, and what in effect they do; becauſe, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapter, one has ſeen what is the power that Popery attributes to the Devil, who are likewiſe capable to effect by the Miniſtry of Men, that is to ſay, of Wizards and Witches, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Leagues, all that they effect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

It will not be, however, beſides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to cite <hi>Bodin,</hi> who tells you in very preciſe terms, the <hi>Second Book, Chap.</hi> 4. how Men expreſly make Leagues with the Devil.

I Know not whether I muſt put the reſt I have to ſay upon the account of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts only, there being but very few of our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion who do not believe it as they do, as I ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter. I ſhall report only in this, what means Popery affords to avoid all ſorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Specters, and to divert them from us. The Firſt means conſiſts in the reſiſtance, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient againſt their Malice. The Second, conſiſts in the finding out of thoſe that are guilty of theſe Abominations. And the Third, in the Puniſhments that theſe People are thought to deſerve. <hi>Schottus</hi> ſhall furniſh me with that which I have to ſay touching the firſt of theſe means: And I ſhall take from other Writings what I am to relate concerning the ſecond and third, to which I ſhall joyn that which may be learned by experience.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Malignant Injuries and Outrages never drive away Spirits, but ſome inſulting terms that are made uſe of in Exorciſms, which have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Church, contribute very much to expel them, <hi>pag.</hi> 304.</p>

               <p n="1">1. At firſt he ſtabliſhes two, againſt which there is nothing to ſay; which are, a ſtedfaſt Faith, and an ardent Prayer, <hi>p.</hi> 214, 215. for they are conform to the Maxims of Scripture. <hi>This ſort of Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be caſt out but by Prayers and Faſtings, St.</hi> Matth. 17.20, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But he eſtabliſhes five others, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented purely by Popery. Firſt, The Relicks of Holy Bodies; or, to ſay better, of thoſe who are taken for ſuch. Secondly, The Sign of the Croſs. Thirdly, Holy Water. Fourthly, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> that is, the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> imprinted upon a little round figure of Wax, and conſecrated by the Pope. They have, ſays <hi>Schottus,</hi> a ready virtue and efficacious, <hi>virtutem praeſtantiſſimam,</hi> to put the Devil to flight, <hi>p.</hi> 322. Fifth, To pronounce the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to call upon the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, <hi>p.</hi> 324. All theſe means are explained, every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in the ſame place. They are alſo deſcribed,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59386:150"/>but a little more abridged, although in the ſame ſenſe, by <hi>John Davidi,</hi> Jeſuit, in his Book Intituled, the <hi>Buckler,</hi> printed at <hi>Balduc,</hi> in the year 1619. I ſhall report his own Words, leſt the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks ſhould accuſe me of impoſing upon them: See what he writes in the 10th Chapter. <hi>Amongſt the Conſecrated things which have power againſt the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes of the Enemy, we muſt rank theſe here. Holy Water, which is every Sunday conſecrated in the Church, and has its name from that Conſecration. The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Water that is Conſecrated on the Vigils of</hi> Eaſter <hi>and</hi> Whitſuntide. <hi>The Holy Water, that is called Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Water, that the Biſhops conſecrate with Salt, Aſhes, and Wine, therewith to conſecrate Altars, and for other Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes. The Candels that are wont to be Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Feaſts of the Purification. The Branches Conſecrated on Palm Sunday; Every one of thoſe operates its effect in being uſed in the ſame manner that they have been Conſecrated, beſprinkling with Water, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Candles, and putting or planting the Branches in ſome particular place. The</hi> Agnus Dei's <hi>that are worn about the Neck, or other places, according to the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration due to them, being Conſecrated by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have alſo a Soveraign virtue to keep the Chriſtian from the Snares, and from all the evil deſigns of the Enemy, or to preſerve him by Sea and Land, from Fire or Water, and all other Perils.</hi> The ſign of the Croſs is alſo of a Marvellous uſe on theſe occaſions; <hi>It being the Chriſtians Duty to be always ready to make againſt all the Temptations the Enemy can give them, as well within as without. The Church makes a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe of it in all its Conſecrations, in its Bleſſings, in the Adminiſtration of the Holy Sacrament; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Exorciſms of Evil Spirits, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations which are made upon People tormented by them: All which things are practiſed to reſiſt the Wiles

For ſee what he ſays, <hi>All that which is not efficacious of it ſelf, nor by ſome natural Virtue, nor by the Inſtitution and Power of God, both which are found in the Sacraments; nor by the Ordinance of the Church, which acts but according to the Word of God, and by the Virtue he communicates to her: All that, I ſay, which is not efficacious by ſome one of theſe means, from which alone the Remedies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any occaſion whatſoever can draw their force; If one dares undertake to make uſe of theſe things, and to apply them for Remedies, it is an action baſely Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and oppoſite to the Will of God and his Word.</hi> Afterwards he begins the 11th Chapter in theſe Terms. <hi>As to the Sacred Word, whoſe power affects the Enemy, the Exorciſms, or the Conjurations which are ordain'd by the Church, have a particular Virtue: Such are the Exorciſms that are made uſe of by the Ritual of</hi> Rome, <hi>and thoſe that are found in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual made for the Archbiſhoprick of</hi> Malines, <hi>ſeen and approved by the Doctors of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of</hi> Lovain. If one has the curioſity to ſee all theſe Doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into practice, he needs but Read <hi>the Hiſtory of the Devils of</hi> Loudun, which has been already cited, where he will ſee from one end to the other, the uſages of the Roman Church concerning Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Exorciſms, which are unknown to all other Religions, and of which thoſe that read them have cauſe to be ſurpriſed.</p>

He ſung the Song of the three Children in the fiery Furnace, he ſaid Maſs, he put the Hoſt in the mouth of the accuſed, and prayed to God that it would pleaſe him to diſcover the crime of Magick, of which he was ſuſpected, in ſuffering that his Hand in which he was puting the red hot Iron, might be burnt, or that he might not receive any hurt, if he were innocent. Theſe Prayers being finiſhed, the accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to go nine ſteps in carrying the burning Iron in his Hand, after which the Prieſt wrapt up has Hand, and ſeal'd the covering that was put to it. The third day he took off the ſeal to conſider his Hand, whether it was ſound and without wound, otherwiſe the unhappy accuſed had but to reſolve to be burnt alive all covered with Paper, painted all over with Devils.</hi>

There is as yet a more particular proof, which is practiſed in <hi>Holland,</hi> althô, not upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves, but upon ſtranger, that are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Ballance. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> inhabitants of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter, Cologne,</hi> and <hi>Paderborne,</hi> and many other more diſtant places have made uſe, ſince the time of the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> to this day, of the publick weights of the Town <hi>D'Oudewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in this ſame Province. It is what I am going to tell you more preciſely by the contents of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by one of the Bourgomaſters of <hi>Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> to a friend of his, and related at the beginning of a little Book, entituled <hi>(Sure means not to paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death unjuſtly.)</hi> The Bourgomaſter ſays chiefly in his Letter, anſwering to queſtions that had been put to him: That all thoſe that came from that Country for this purpoſe, <hi>unanimouſly complain'd, that they had been unjuſtly accuſed of Magick in their Country, and that if they were ſo unhappy as not to find proofs of their innocence in the weights of the Town of</hi> Oudewater, <hi>with which it was neceſſarily required, their Bodies ſhould be in equal weight, for their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; they ran a danger upon their return of looſing their Life and Eſtate: Becauſe the common belief of that Country is, that thoſe, who weigh leſs than the weight that is put againſt them into the other part of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59386:153"/>ballance, (ſuch as agreed upon, as will be preſently ſeen) are undoubtedly Sorcerers.</hi> The Burgomaſter adds, <hi>that the late Secretary</hi> Hoy <hi>had told him, that in his time there was a certain Inhabitant of the upper Country, who having had a difference with one of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he cauſed a diſcourſe thro' the Country, that the other was a Wizard: Some adviſed this pretended Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer to go into</hi> Holland, <hi>and to be weighed with the weights of</hi> Oudewater, <hi>to the end he might take off, by this means, the calumny. He goes thither, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ſtupidity, imprudence, or fear, or for not being well informed of what muſt be practiſed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his own Country without being weighed. They did not fail to aske him whether he had undergone this Tryal, which he could not ſhew; upon which ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions being increaſed, it was believed he was found too light, and that he was guilty. The diſcourſe being come to the Ears of the Judge of the place, he gave order to take him up; but he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will at preſent leave the Papiſts and paſs to the Proteſtants, whoſe Religion and Doctrine is more pure. They ſuffer not themſelves to ſtray ſo much as others, about the matter in hand; for neither believing Purgatory, nor admitting the invocation of Angels and deceaſed Saints, they cannot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agree in their Opinions with the Papiſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning apparitions and the operations of Spirits, more eſpecially in relation to theſe two points; and the conſequences that are neceſſarily drawn from thence, when they are admitted. However it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the belief and practices of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans upon this ſubject, come much nearer thoſe of Popery than the belief of the People of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is alſo to be conſidered, that there is among the Proteſtants in general, a great deal of difference between the common People and the learned; it is true, that there is likewiſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſome difference between thoſe two kinds of People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among the Papiſts, and even among the Pagans. There appears no leſs among the Men of Letters in particular, ſome holding the common belief and helping it, others rejecting it, and others at leaſt taking a kind of a medium between thoſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59386:154"/>two parties; ſo there are found among us People, who believe almoſt all that is ſaid of Witchcraft and Specters. There are others, who deny all moſt all, but the greateſt part, partly admit that which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſaid, and partly reject it. That being ſuppoſed, we muſt ſtill underſtand with relation to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, what I have to ſay in this work touching that of the reformed Religion. But however, to abridge my diſcourſe rather than extend it, it will be neceſſary, firſt to propoſe the common Opinion and the ordinary practice; and afterwards the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of People the moſt ſenſible, and the moſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part.</p>

It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in general, that Angels have been from the beginning all created by God, of which one part having revolted againſt him, are become Devils. But afterwards continuing to ſpeak of the Devil, he is ſpoken of as ſingly as the Enemy of Mankind, and chiefly of the faithful, hunting continually after occaſions of doing ill. There is every where had a high Opinion of his underſtanding, power, and action; he is conceived, or at leaſt ſpoken of as one, and yet they make him to be preſent in all places, he acts every where, he ſpies and ſets his Hand to every thing. I'll explain this here ſomething more particularly.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59386:155"/>when they are threatned with the death of ſome of their friends, or ſome other evil accident. It is believed further, that a Divine may declare where one ſhall find what is loſt, whether a Man is bewitch'd, and who is the Author of the miſchief, and what means there are to deliver him and many other ſuch like things.</p>

The Opinion of the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, has been doubtleſs urged to exceſs, for neither God nor Jeſus Chriſt have ever done any thing great or marvellous but the People aſcribe to the Devil, I have ſhewn before in ſome manner, <hi>Ch.</hi> 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. That thoſe thoughts proceeded from the <hi>Manichees.</hi> When God permits him he can appear to Men in all ſorts of figures, not only in thoſe of good and bad Men living or Dead, but alſo in thoſe of ſeveral Beaſts; from this ſame principle comes the belief that is ſtill in being, that wicked debauched Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple transform themſelves alſo by the power of the Devil, making uſe of means deſigned for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, into many ſhapes of Beaſts, as of Wolves, but particularly into that of Cats, and being ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured they paſs though the quarrel of a glaſs win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or the hole of a Bell, to go in the night to the <hi>Sabat,</hi> as I have already ſaid; or rather they ride on Horſeback upon a ſtick up the Chimney, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to this time cannot be rooted out among us, from the mind of the People; further it is imagined, that theſe ſame People may, with the cooperation of the Devil, ſtir up tempeſts, ſhut the wind up into a Handkerchief, and let it out when they will, which however is ſeldom attributed but to the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and to <hi>Finlanders,</hi> to which the ſtories that are made of their practices, have given occaſion, ſo great is the credulity of the People, even for the moſt abſurd thing; they perſwade themſelves alſo, that theſe People devoted to the Devil, learn of

It is not doubted but leagues are made between the Devil and Magicians, by which means all theſe accident happen; People are even perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the effect of the proofs by Water, into which the accuſed are thrown, and of a great many other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things; above all of the uſefulneſs of the advice the exorciſts give, as that endeavouring to cauſe the perſon bewitch'd, to be bleſt by him that has done the miſchief, which is held for an remedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; if the pretended Sorcerer refuſes to do it, he may be forced to it by blows, and by violencies Another remedy is to bake ſome certain things in ſome certain Pot, for a certain number of hours, to a certain hour of the Day or Night. The guilty is forced by this means, to come to the houſe, and conſequently make himſelf known, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd perſon ſwallows what has been baked, or carries ſomthing about his Neck, or hanging upon his Breaſt.

The uſe that is made of all theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the conſequences that are drawn from them, are to attribute to the inſpirations and ſollicitations of the Devil, all theſe extraordinary events, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſins that are committed, eſpecially, thoſe that are moſt enormous. If a ſudden tempeſt ariſes, and that there is ſome in our company who is not very much our friend, and is a little ſuſpected of being a Witch, we do not fail of imputing to him this diſorder. If any one gives a little Cake, a Sugar plum, an Apple, or other fruit to a Child, who comes very ſuddainly after to fall into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing

I have ſpoken hitherto of the Opinions and practices of the common People only, I ſhall now ſnow, that which our Doctors and our Men of letters believe upon this point. There are none ſo credulous as the Vulgar; however there is a very conſiderable difference to be ſeen in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſome believing almoſt every thing, and others almoſt nothing at all. Theſe two Opinions ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ought to be attributed to two Scots; to the one an Illuſtrious <hi>King of Great Brittain,</hi> which is, <hi>King James,</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Firſt <hi>King of England</hi> of that name; and the other, to one of his Scotch Subjects, a Scot by birth as by name, being call'd <hi>Reynard Scot;</hi> the King held the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as to the popular Opinion of Witchcraft, and Apparition of Spirits, which his ſubject had already confuted. <hi>John Wierus</hi> who lived in the begining of the Reformation made by means of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> had from that time publiſhed his Opinion upon the deluſion of Spirits and upon the impoſtures of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and he had taken a part which held in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between thoſe two Opinions; ſo <hi>King James</hi> in his Book of <hi>Demonology</hi> conteſted with theſe two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, according to his expreſs Declaration in the Preface.</p>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59386:156"/>leagues that Magicians make with the Devil, that it ſeems as if the King himſelf had ſeen the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or that they had been reported in the Council. In the fourth Chapter of the ſecond Book, the King puts for certain, that evil Spirits may carry Men through the Air, or aſſume divers forms, to viſit the Magicians, when they are in Priſon. In the ſeventh Chapter, he ſays, that in the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Paganiſm, there was a great many more Apparitions; but that it was obſerved, that ſince this laſt Reformation of the Chriſtian Church, there have been fewer Apparitions, and a great many more Witchcrafts. Concerning the apparitions of Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Phantoms, of which he treats in the Third Book, there are ſcarce any kind to which this Prince gives not credit, even to <hi>Incubuſſes</hi> and <hi>Succubuſſes,</hi> which are Spirits, who, as Men, mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carnally with Women, and as Women with Men. In reference to the poſſeſt, the King agrees that the Popiſh Prieſt may drive out the Devil; but upon the proofs that he has to convince one of the crime of Magick, he only ſays, there muſt be no leſs than twelve witneſſes, amongſt which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Infants, infamous People, and even thoſe that are taken to be Magicians.</p>

Now althô the learned, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, extol not ſo much all theſe things, nor teach them ſo expreſly; and that by conſequence, they credit not ſo much what is ordinarily believed and ſaid touching the power and Operations of the Devil upon Men, and concerning that which they effect by the means of Men; we muſt however ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they give ſo much extent to his power and actions, that not only they help not to deſtroy the general Opinion that is had of him; but alſo maintain it by different expreſſions they make uſe of, and by the inſtructions they give. It is what
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59386:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>is ſeen, eſpecially in the works of two Engliſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who explain themſelves more plainly, and preciſely than all others upon this matter, which they treat from the foundation; whereas others keep the ſame language only by occaſion, and when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other ſubjects, they are obliged to ſpeak of them. The firſt of theſe Authors is, <hi>William Gurnal</hi> in his great Book upon the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 6.11.18. entituled, <hi>The Chriſtian in compleat Armour,</hi> the firſt Edition is in the <hi>Year</hi> 1655.

He pretends, that what he eſtabliſhes as a certain Truth, is grounded upon Reaſons and Examples: And I grant, that as to the force of Reaſoning, I do not know any Writer who has better ſucceeded than he has. Here are his ſuppoſed Truths; That among other effects, which are attributed to Magicians of both Sexes. Firſt, <hi>Being anointed with certain Magical Ointments they paſs through the Chimney, and are tranſported into very diſtant places.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they are turned into Cats, Hares, and divers other Creatures and Figures.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That they feel in their own Bodies the ſame wounds that are made in the Bodies they borrow.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That in muttering certain unintelligible Words, and in making certain Geſtures extraordinary and ridiculous, they raiſe Tempeſts.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That they are ſucked by familiar Spirits in the moſt ſecret parts of their Bodies.</hi> The Author believes that the more theſe things are incredible and ridiculous, the more certain they are. I ſhall examine his Reaſons in my ſecond and third Book, and his Inſtances in my laſt, with more exactneſs than what other Authors have written upon this Subject, for the conſideration I have already alledged; that he carries it above all others, as to the force of his Reaſoning.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59386:158"/>Moreover, the Opinions which have been reported having paſſed from Popery amongſt us, and been admitted by many Doctors of our Communion; yet I know not any who has taken their part ſo much as <hi>Daneus,</hi> which is chiefly obſerved in two Points in his Deſcription of the Leagues, and in the effects he attributes to Sorcerers and Witches; for theſe two things are found very amply treated of in his little Book, <hi>De Sortiariis, Of Witches;</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt is deſcribed with more circumſtances than I have read in any Popiſh Author. So ſeeing this Doctor has been one of the moſt conſiderable among us, and that having lived a little after the time of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> his Book, which was written 116 years ago, has not been attacked nor contradicted that I know of by any Proteſtant Writer, but only by <hi>Schottus;</hi> from thence may be inferr'd, that theſe Doctrines are not unknown to us, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Proteſtant Churches. I am going to relate in ſhort the contents of this Author's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>

See what he ſets down in his fourth Chapter, <hi>Nullum non Sortiarum cum Satana foedus iniiſſe, ſeque ei devoviſſe, That there is no Sorcerer but he has made agreement with the Devil, and devoted himſelf to him:</hi> See the deſcription he makes of theſe contracts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſecure the Perſon of the Magician, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil imprints a mark either under the Eye-lids, or between the Buttocks, or the Pallat of the Mouth, that it may not be perceived in thoſe places. The Author believes that there are none exempt from carrying it: It is for this Reaſon, that the Judges order the whole Body of thoſe that are accuſed of this Crime, to be ſhaved, to know the place that is marked, as I have told you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Conditions of theſe Contracts imply that they ſhall renounce God, and acknowledge Satan, and adore him for their God, and in Recompence he ſhall
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59386:158"/>aſſiſt them, and ſhall come to their ſuccour as oft as they apply themſelves to him, which he will never fail to do no more than the Witches on their part fail to obey all his Commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>After the Covenant has been thus mutually agreed upon, the Magician, the morrow after, ſacrifices to the Devil, a Dog, a Cat, or a Hen, that belongs to him, by which means the Contract is confirmed a new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Afterwards the Devil cauſes in proper time and place, all the Magicians to aſſemble where ever he preſcribes; there he makes every one of them give an account of the Miſchiefs he has done by his Power and Means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He ſometimes takes the trouble to get them together, aſſuming a human ſhape for that purpoſe, and making himſelf known to the Magicians only: At other times he imploys ſome of them to go and Convene the Aſſembly, ſhewing them the time and place: This Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is not always general, ſometimes there are but a certain number which he has choſen to pleaſe himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If there are ſome, who through weakneſs of Body cannot go, he gives them a Stick, or a Horſe, of ſome Oyntment to anoint themſelves, by the virtue of which being become inviſible, he tranſports them through the Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>He appears himſelf as Maſter of the Club, in ſhape of a Man, or in ſome ugly He-Goat, or in whatever Form he pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>There they repeat their Oaths made to him, after which they ſing and dance in honour of their new God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Afterwards he furniſhes them with ſuch means as they deſire, to do miſchief to ſuch as they pleaſe. He teaches them to make up their Poiſons, and promiſes them to continue his aſſiſtance to them, and his ſervice for their occaſions.</hi>

               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59386:159"/>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>By virtue of theſe Agreements Satan fails not to work wonders in favour of his Magicians, as oft as they make the ſign that he has taught them, and ordered them to do, in which ſign conſiſts not the operative and active faculty, as the Magicians believe, but it reſides in the Devil, who operates when warned by the ſign.</hi>

There is already a great deal, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are more things which the Author aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the Devil, and which may be gathered and inferred from divers places of this Book, where they are expreſsly contained, as:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he often appears in human ſhape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he ſometimes troubles, and caſts ſuch a Miſt over the Senſes of thoſe that are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with him, that they fancy to have been in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, and to have acted ſeveral things, though there is no truth or reality in theſe Imaginations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But he really carries them through the Air whither he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That by the Miniſtry of Wizzards and Witches, he can Poiſon Men ſecretly from far, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the Devil, or the Magicians by his means, may raiſe Tempeſts, and cauſe Rain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He rejects the Opinion of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the power of the Devil has no longer any effect upon the Magicians, nor can act in their behalf, as ſoon as they are in the Hands and Power of Juſtice; on the contrary, he ſuppoſes, that the virtue of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft may be exerted even in Priſons; and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Devil breaks there the Necks of thoſe who belong to him: Theſe are <hi>Daneus</hi>'s his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Furthermore, the moſt common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctors of our Communion, is, That the Devil does not know things to come, but only of himſelf he forms conjectures; that nevertheleſs the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59386:159"/>greateſt part of Divines conſult him for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. That it is from him they learn what they diſcover to other Men of things preſent, things hidden; as when there has been ſomething ſtoll'n, or ſome body bewitch'd, they declare the Thief or Magician. They likewiſe aſcribe to him ſome knowledge of the Thoughts of Men, ſince they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that he diſturbs and ſeduces them, and that he incites them to miſchief. For that is properly what we underſtand when we pray in our Churches for thoſe that are tempted and troubled in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. There are no errors produced, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes no Hereſies in the Church, it is not afflicted with any perſecution, but the Devil has contributed thereto. All the places of Scripture, that ſpeak of the Devil, are underſtood with relation to theſe Ideas: And it is upon theſe interpretations that theſe Opinions are grounded. It is alſo by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that not only the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but almoſt all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers aſſert, That it is not allow'd to conſult the Devil, who is the enemy of God, and of Men, nor to ſeek his help: They however agree, that the <hi>Pagan Oracles</hi> have not always been given by the Devil, but that often they have been the effect of the impoſtures of Prieſts, which has ſo often appear'd, that it is impoſſible not to know it.</p>

The power of the Devil is extreamlv boaſted of, for there are very few Doctors who doubt but he can aſſume a Body, and poſſeſs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, and tranſport and torment them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, as effectively, as he had actually the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to do theſe things to our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and to a great many people, of which the Goſpel tell us that being poſſeſt by evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they were delivered by our Saviour. They alſo ſuppoſe, that the opinion of the apparitions of

As to the means which Magicians, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, and Inchanters make uſe of, ſcarce is there a perſon of good Senſe, that believes they are effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of themſelves, but they will have it to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Devil, who operates all that thoſe miſerable wretches imagine to act; and that the Covenants made between him and them, oblige him to execute that which they require of him; provided only, that they make uſe of Signs and that they imploy circumſtances deſtin'd for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſuch as he has taught them. It is very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently obſerved, as is believed, that thoſe Leagues are made two ways, which I ſhall expreſs in the words of <hi>Sennertus,</hi> taken from his Treatiſe upon this Queſtion. <hi>Whether one may be render'd invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to the point of a Sword, and to Muſquets?</hi> where he ſays, <hi>That the Contract with the Devil is of two kinds, mediate or immediate; expreſs or tacite. The immediate, or expreſs Contract, is when any makes uſe of means, that he has been immediately furniſhed with by the Devil. The mediate or tacite Contract is, when one makes uſe of the means, which in truth have been
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59386:160"/>ordain'd by the Devil; but not having been ſupply'd by the Devil himſelf, comes to him by the hand of ſome other perſon; which is directly contrary to the Law of God, that forbids us to have other Gods but him:</hi> For he ſays a little further, <hi>The conſent is not altogether excluded from the tacite agreement, becauſe, whoſoever is not as yet deprived of Reaſon, as not to avoid the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of Rocks, or the mouth of a Pit, he cannot but ſee that ſuch Words and Characters have not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any virtue; and that by conſequence, before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of them, we are obliged to examin by what virtue they may produce ſuch effects: for if one neglects to do it, it is certain a tacite Contract with the Devil, who has promiſed to execute all the clauſes and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his writing in favour of thoſe who make uſe of the Words and Characters therein contained, in conſequence of which, he who makes uſe of it, cannot pretend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf innocent of the crime of Magick.</hi> Such is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi>'s opinion, and as I may judge from my own experience, will not be confuted by our Doctors, for I hear them generally hold ſpeaking the ſame Language. Doctor <hi>Wierius,</hi> a famous Man, who had very much meditated upon this matter, and had ſtudied it very much, eſtabliſhes all theſe things a little more confuſedly, but yet very near upon the ſame foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. I have ſomething to add here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dreams. The common Language of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, is, that there are four ſorts; Natural, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or ſuch as are occaſion'd by the preceding converſation and actions, without Nature or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per having any ſhare in them; Laſtly, Divine or Diabolical. They hold that theſe laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the inſpiration of the Devil, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the imagination of Man, and repreſents to him fearful Figures, to diſquiet or fright him, or to tranſport him for ſome time into ſome place
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59386:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>where he pleaſes: as we have ſeen before, that he tranſports the Witches to their ſeveral meetings. In conſequence of this Doctrine, there are ſome of opinion, that the Dream that <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Wife ſuffered ſo much becauſe of Chriſt, was a Diabolick Dream.</p>

But I find not any of theſe Doctors who have heretofore ever attributed ſo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Power to the Devil; as to the knowledge and effects already deſcribed, as <hi>Reynold Schot</hi> has, before quoted. We have at this time <hi>Anthony Van Dalen,</hi> who aſcribes no more to him in his Book of <hi>Oracles:</hi> theſe two Authors hold that there is no other efficient cauſe of all the things which are practiſed, or which are operated, but the impoſtures of Men; the Devil having no part in them. I learn alſo, whilſt I am taken up in this preſent Work, that the moſt ſenſible among us, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute but very little power and knowledge to the Devil: and that there are a great many more than I conceived, who, as to the actions of the poſſeſt and bewitched are of the ſame opinion with Mr. <hi>Daillon,</hi> who in a <hi>French</hi> Book concerning Demons, maintains all that which is contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, touching evil and unclean Spirits, is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be underſtood, than of certain Diſeaſes to which the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to give ſuch names, believing, however that it might happen, evil Spirits medl'd with them at the ſame time. There's lately come to my hands very conveniently, a little Book of Mr. <hi>Orchard</hi>'s an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> Preacher in the <hi>New-Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> as I am told, in which the ancient and common opinion upon this ſubject is confuted, as being directly oppoſite to the Doctrine and belief of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>

It is not neceſſary to ſpeak of them here, becauſe my intention is not to ſet down here what is not ſaid of the Devil, and what is not attributed to him; but my deſign is to relate that which is ſaid of him, and to examine whether it be true or no. 'Tis ſufficient for me to hold the laſt Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writer, becauſe I am much averſe from maintaining the opinion which aſcribes ſo much power and virtue to Spirits; and eſpecially to the bad. And further, I ſhall be obliged to enter the Liſt with <hi>Schot, Van Dalen,</hi> and many others, who oppoſe the common belief that they had of this Power, when I ſhall come afterwards to examine the reaſons and proofs upon which it is founded. However, before I finiſh this Firſt Part, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe all that has been ſaid, and compare the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Infidels with thoſe of the Chriſtians.</p>

There remains now to compare thoſe of the Papiſts and Proteſtants, after which we will confer them all together; to that end, we muſt break off the order that we have kept hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and begin with the laſt; they will furniſh us with very certain proof, that there is no Opinion to which the World is more engag'd, than to that which is almoſt generally every where taught and received concerning Spirits; for the Proteſtants have retained all that which cannot be look't upon as a pure invention of Popery in particular; and there are even ſome, whoſe belief upon this ſubject, go farther than thoſe of the Papiſts. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in general believe all that is not particular to the Jews and Pagans; the Jews and the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans believe all that, according to them, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant with the belief of one only God; ſome will tell me perhaps, that we muſt not wonder at it, and that naturally it ought to be ſo.

I intend not to ſpeak of particular Opinions, but of thoſe generally received, taught, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by practices; for as to the common People, either Papiſts, Jews, or Pagans, they know nothing for the moſt part, but a little by hear-ſay; ſo that there is no relying upon them, and it is ſure without miſtake, that for the moſt part, what the moſt illiterate believe and practice, is contrary to the ſenſe of Divines, and of all thoſe that underſtand any thing in the Holy Scripture.

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Pagans, the Jews, and the Ancient Chriſtians have believed that there is another kind of Spirits, which are placed between God and the Angels, or which are in ſome ſort corporeal, but it is not granted any more at this time by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> Likewiſe it is not uſual among them, to aſſociate God, or the Spirits to the Stars. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, it was an Opinion purely Pagan; and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59386:164"/>ouching Spirits, it was a Jewiſh Opinion; I know not whether it may be ſaid, that the Ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had not ſome tincture of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> This difference of nature in the Angels, propoſed by the Jews, is not believed any more; it draws its Original from Ancient Paganiſm, and is admitted to this day, by the modern Pagans; It's true, that the Papiſts acknowledge a difference of Order, but they put none in the eſſence of theſe Spirits. Likewiſe, thô they make generally appear all ſorts of Spirits, nevertheleſs the difference is only in reſpect of places, of Perſons, and effects, as we have ſhewn more fully, <hi>Ch.</hi> 19 <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.2.3. but it is no way in reſpect of their nature, nor of their Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> There is not a Chriſtian, be he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant or Papiſt, who believes, that Spirits are truly capable of engendering; which is nevertheleſs the common belief of all the Pagans, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among the Jews, and has not been confuted ſufficiently by the primitive Chriſtians, among whom are found, ſome who have expreſly taught it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. But the Pagans differ from the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Chriſtians chiefly in two points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they mix and confound together the ſupream God with other ſuperior and inferior Gods good and bad; and alſo the Souls of Men with all thoſe Gods, in ſuch a confuſed manner, that it is impoſſible to comprehend any thing, and that it is a Labyrinth from whence they cannot extricate themſelves. On the contrary, the Jews and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans agree with the Chriſtians, in this point, that there is one only God, and that all that is beſides him has been created by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> In that, that not only they make no great difficulty to deify Men, but that they make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Gods return to the condition of Men, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59386:164"/>that they believe there are Men, the iſſue of the Gods; there are ſome of theſe errors, which the Papiſts cannot boaſt of being entirely free from; for they may reaſonably be reproached, that they have ſubſtituted their Saints to theſe imaginary Gods, and to thoſe Demons of the Pagans; That they ſpeak of Saints as the Pagans do of their Gods; that they make them act in the ſame manner, that theſe falſe Deities were ſuppoſed to act. But pure Chriſtianity, ſuch as has been in all times upon this point, never make Gods a Man, nor never raiſes Man to the dignity of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. There is notwithſtanding ſome point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Proteſtants are not agreed, and upon which, nevertheleſs the Papiſts, the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the Jews, the Mahometans, and all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans agree, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tutelary Gods of the Pagans, who were the guardian Angels in the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. We have lately ſeen they are admitted without conteſtation among the Papiſts; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in general, are not diſpoſed to receive this Opinion; thoſe of the profeſſion of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> reject it; and nevertheleſs there are ſome, but very few, that admit it, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not that there are ſufficient reaſons to oppoſe it; we ſhall examine afterwards, which is the ſoundeſt of theſe Opinions. In the mean while we muſt take notice before hand, that what the Papiſts teach upon this ſubject, together with ſome of other Chriſtians that are not of their Communion, relates more to the light and knowledge which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that thoſe Spirits communicate to them, than real help they can expect in their actions, and in their manner of living; for it is rarely ſeen, or to ſay better, it is never ſeen, that the People aſcribe a conſiderable deliverance, or a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that befal them to an Angel, either their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59386:165"/>keeper or their enemy; but they never fail to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it immediatly to the providence of God; or if they ſometimes turn their Eyes to another ſide, the Papiſts as to their particular refer all the good that happens to them, to the protection of ſome great Saint, eſpecially to that of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but the Proteſtants, leſt they ſhould ſeem to favour the belief of the Popiſh Saints, would rather ſay, if occaſion ſerves, that the Devil was the Author of it,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. There is alſo a difference to be taken notice of, betwixt the Heathens on one ſide, the Jews and the Mahometans on the other, and all the Chriſtians on another; it is chiefly in the practice of Witchcraft and Divination; which, according to the principles of the firſt, is a laudable practice in it ſelf, althô often abuſed, as a great many good things are; according to the principles of the ſecond, it is only allow'd and uſeful in many occaſions; and according to the laſt it is directly oppoſite to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. The reaſon of it is, that the Pagans hold for Gods, or at leaſt for Miniſters and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Gods, Spirits, which are lookt upon by Chriſtians as unpure Spirits; and that the Jews and the Mahometans cauſe to proceed from the Virtue of the <hi>Caballa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the influences of the Stars, whatever the Chriſtians take to be Magick, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, or Enchantments. It is true, that in the time of Ancient Paganiſm, the Mathematicians have been put into the rank of Poiſoners, and that both were treated as perſons equally pernicious, to whom it was forbidden to exerciſe their art, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. But the occaſion of theſe prohibitions, was only founded upon the ill uſe that was made of this Art, which had been before not only permitted, but even much eſteem'd. At this time the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have no longer any averſion for the name of Mathematician, but that of Poyſoner never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any good interpretation; no that words are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59386:165"/>here to be diſputed, for 'tis of things that we treat; and we are to examine them, and not words. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there will be occaſion to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, in our third Book; where without doubt, it will be neceſſary to ſpeak fully of theſe terms, and of many others.</p>

BEfore I paſs to my ſecond Book, where I ſhall examine what is purely the truth, we muſt ſearch into all the quotations and Opinions that are collected here, after the Original of this Opinion, ſo general and ſo deeply rooted, touching the great power of the Devil, which we ſee, that all the Chriſtians, Proteſtants, Romans and others, carry ſo high at this time; there is none who can deny but ſeveral things preſent themſelves in theſe narrations, that all the World eaſily perceives and are capable to produce ſuch Opinions, or to confirm them in the minds of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, I intend to ſhow firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all that is believed touching the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Devil, beyond what Scripture and Reaſon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59386:166"/>manifeſtly teaches us of it, proceeds not from any of theſe two ſprings, nor takes it's Original from any conſequences that may be drawn from them, and afterwards to diſcover what is the true cauſe of it.</p>

The truth of this propoſition is eaſily known as to it's firſt reſpect; becauſe it is known, that the moſt ſtupid and thoſe that partake leaſt of the light of Reaſon or of knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are thoſe which give moſt credit to what is ſaid upon the matter in hand. The common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Children, and Old Women, are much more perſwaded of it than others; but the more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one has, the more one is converſant in the Holy writ, and the more experience he has gained by the converſation of the World, and by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent accidents which have preſented themſelves, eſpecially when experience is joyned to theſe two firſt Conditions, the leſs he will be apt to believe ſuch Opinions; I ſay he will be the leſs apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, becauſe it muſt be granted, that there are People of a great deal of learning and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who not only receive them, but impl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But I think not that we muſt believe what they have done, ought to be attributed to the evidence of reaſon, which have perſwaded them, but to their prejudices, and to a certain particular inclination, according to which, every one turns himſelf toward ſuch or ſuch an object, according to his inclination. It is by the motions of this natural inclination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the underſtanding being ſurprized, takes a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to follow it; and when it has once addicted it ſelf thereto, it makes uſe of all it's force and light to maintain its choice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſhew that truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> 3. It may be objected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to what concerns Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it cannot be ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that what was never taught by the Pagans and Philoſophers, who had not the help of any other Light but that of Nature and Reaſon; or what they have left in their Writings, was drawn from any other ſpring but Nature it ſelf. I grant it; But what have they taught upon this ſubject? All that we have reported before in the ten Chapters, that are betwixt the firſt and twelfth: There every one may ſee what it is; what are their uncertainty and contradictions; how different and oppoſite among them are their practices. What foundation can be laid upon a Philoſophy, which has not ſought but to accommodate it ſelf to capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and prejudiced People; and which conſiſts almoſt in nothing elſe but the Tricks of Prieſts. Beſides, it is not a pure Philoſophy that has been the original and foundation of Pagan Religions; but the Philoſophy ſuch as it has been comprehended and underſtood by the People; that is to ſay, very ill in part or in the whole, mixed with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and great ignorance. The fear cauſed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ſurpriſing objects, and the blind love every one has for his own Notions, produced in that perturbation, drive Men to ſeek the means to appeaſe a power from which proceed thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary objects, and which is the cauſe of thoſe evils they are not able to reſiſt. Theſe two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſay, carry Men to practiſe, for that end, all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59386:167"/>ſorts of means, although they know them but by half's, or not at all. The greateſt part of thoſe who might diſcover to them their Miſtakes, and afford them better Inſtructions; either will not give themſelves the trouble, or chooſe rather to keep it ſecret, and make uſe of the Error of the People, to the end to acquire more Credit, and to be the objects of a greater admiration; as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Magi</hi> did; and as at this time the <hi>Bramines</hi> and the <hi>Bonzes</hi> do: If there is any one who had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inclinations, he dares not open his Mouth for fear of incurring the indignation of the publick; As <hi>Socrates</hi> whoſe boldneſs coſt him his life, which was taken away by Poiſon.</p>

We muſt therefore imagine, that there are not any of thoſe that addicted themſelves to Philoſophy, who from their youth had not been bred in the Opinions, and exerciſe of the Religion of their Anceſtors; So that they owe unto the Schools the Prejudices that they had thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſwallowed. They found Maſters who were no leſs prevented with theirs; either that they were alike to thoſe of their Scholars, or that they were different. If they were alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Diſciples were confirm'd in thoſe prejudices by their Maſters; and if they were different, they afforded them more matter to confound their Underſtanding. Laſtly, However it was, their Underſtanding could but remain corrupted, and their ill diſpoſition but daily increaſe. If this needed a proof, and required leſs time, it would be no hard task to prove what I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; ſince I may name Perſons, who may be living inſtances of it: But no body, methinks, will require from me what I have juſt now ſaid, being too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be call'd in queſtion. If there are ſome who never reflected upon it, in relation to the Infidels, he need but make Conſiderations upon the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

Thoſe Opinions being already rooted in the mind as deeply as they can be, before the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> be ever read; not to ſay, that the leſs we read it, the more we credit what is ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, and the more we are diſpoſed to affirm it. Had we not in matter of Religion, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions alike to thoſe of other Sects, and even to thoſe of the Unfaithful, we would doubtleſs make a good uſe of the ſacred Writings, and ſpeak as they do. But to our great ſhame, moſt part of us, as well as of other Sects, that pretend a Veneration for the Holy Writ, ſearch not in it after its Senſe, being ſatisfied with the vulgar Interpretations, and ſuch as they have received from others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we keep to ſuch Explications as we hear in thoſe Churches, in which thoſe of our Communion uſe to gather; unleſs we will be look'd upon as fickle headed, and almoſt as Apoſtates. In vain we
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59386:168"/>endeavour to render the Reaſon of our Faith; that's not the queſtion, that way carries too far, and it would be too great a task to examine all to the bottom. In ſhort, to ſpeak truth, we muſt confeſs, that if we believe ſuch great and wonderful things of the Devil, it is not becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Holy Scripture, ſince we ſuſpend not our Judgment till we have conſulted it, but becauſe we are perſuaded before-hand, that it muſt be explain'd and underſtood according to the Judgment we have already paſs'd, by reaſon of ſome expreſſions that ſeem to favour the common Belief, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Men already have of the Devil.</p>

If we deſire more particularly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the Notion of theſe things is formed in Men of Learning, by the means of Learning it ſelf, and how it is increaſed; I am ready to declare what I have obſerved for a long time, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments I have made. The firſt prejudices of Man are as ancient as his knowledge, and begin from his moſt tender youth theſe two ways. When to appeaſe the crys of Children, or to calm their Paſſions, they are threatned with the Bugbear, either by Words or Effects, either by making ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Noiſe, or preſenting to them ſurpriſing Objects; Experience has long ſince taught us, that theſe Impreſſions being the firſt, are alſo thoſe that leave the deepeſt tracks in the Brain, and cannot afterwards be rooted out but with great trouble; when Children being more advanced in years begin to play in the Streets, and to diſcourſe with their Neighbours, they hear almoſt at every inſtant, the name of the Devil pronounced, that is, as a kind of ornament to the common Converſation: They hear Tales told of him under the ſpecious title of Hiſtories, concerning Hobgoblins, Phantaſms, and Witchcraft. Even their Parents, and ſome of their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59386:169"/>Maſters, by a deplorable miſtake never check their Children in their Houſe, their Diſciples in their Schools, nor their Apprentices in their Shops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning the Devil in their Reproofs, and enforcing their chiding with it. The Names of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are not half ſo much uſed in thoſe occaſions, where they would be ſo lawful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; but on the contrary they ſeem to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd from the Mouths of moſt Men.</p>

When Youths are put to School, they read almoſt nothing from the loweſt to the higheſt Forms, in the Greek and Latin Books, but what concerns the Demons and their Effects, as they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Heathens. They are imbu'd with that Science before they attain to thoſe that relate to the uſe of this Life, and that are call'd <hi>Faculties.</hi> The infernal Gods and Goddeſſes; as <hi>Pluto, Vulcan, Proſerpine,</hi> are known very early, and grown fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Youth, before they are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the knowledge of the true God.

For if Parents are not pious enough to take care in their Houſes of the inſtruction of their Children, in what concerns Religion, and to have an Eye upon their information, as to this point in the Schools; I believe not, that of 25 Books, which are made uſe of in the Latin Schools to learn Sciences, more than one or two, are fit to inculcate the Grounds of Chriſtianity to the tender Youth.

The curious Youth are more eager to learn ſuch things, than thoſe they ought to know. Carried away by the heat of their Blood, always ready to take fire and flight, they ardently apply themſelves, obſtinately to defend the part of their Maſters, and direct their Studies, eſpecially after the enquiry of ſuch Reaſons, as may help them to maintain the Opinions they have embraced, and to confute their Antagoniſts. So that whenever a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Holy Writ is alledg'd, for, or againſt their Sentiments, either in Divinity or Philoſophy, they exert all their ability and ſubtilty to wreſt it, or to put upon it, ſuch a Senſe as favours the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with which they are prejudiced.

I ſay, that the Character of Philoſophy, ſuch as is learned in the Schools, pours it ſelf upon all the Interpretations and Tranſlations that are of the Holy Writ. It was the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the four Elements; Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, were included within one another as by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, reaching from the Center to the higheſt place of the Univerſe: So as that the Earth was the loweſt, being mixed with Water in its Superficies, and the Air above it ſurrounding the Terraqueous Globe. Theſe Propoſitions are granted by all. But that Philoſopher alſo believes that Fire ſurrounds the Air, as the Celeſtial Heavens divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vaults do Fire. Theſe Vaults, to which the Sun, Moon and Stars are faſtned, and are of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and incorruptible matter in themſelves, ſurround one another, and turn about us every year, every month, and every day, by the vertue of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirits, call'd <hi>Aſſiſting Forms.</hi> Thoſe that hold that Opinion for probable, are very apt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the wicked Spirits dwell in the Air; becauſe the ſuperiour Spheres are too pure for them. When therefore thoſe ſort of Men hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioning <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. <hi>Or the Spiritual Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> Ch. 6.12. they doubt not but St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that by theſe words of the Holy Scripture, the wicked Spirits muſt be underſtood. Thus thoſe who by reading <hi>Plato,</hi> have fill'd their heads with his Demons, fancy that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> believe Man has an Idea of God in his Underſtanding, found the ſame Doctrine in <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and underſtood in that Senſe, theſe Words of his <hi>Epiſtle to the Romans,</hi> Ch. 1.19. <hi>That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them; for God has ſhewed it unto them.</hi> Even ſome of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Followers have explained the Hiſtory of the Creation in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> according to the principles of that Philoſopher, that is quite contrary to the right meaning of this Narration, as the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes in his little Book, Intituled, <hi>Carteſius Moſaiſans.</hi>

Their Homilies, that is their Sermons, contain but few Expoſitions of the Holy Scripture, and ſtill fewer Tranſlations. 'Tis true, that <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>St. Jerom,</hi> have taken more pains than the others, and been alſo more puzled, having tranſlated the Sacred Writings in thoſe Ages, in which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Tongues was not much look'd after, nor improv'd. In the mean while, what thoſe Doctors hape propos'd upon many ſeparate paſſages, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd thro' their Writings, (upon which, inſtead of a ſerious examination, they have put the Senſe that was moſt favourable to their private Opinions) has ever been received and taught afterwards. Thus 'tis hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd long after, the knowlege of Tongues not be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing better improv'd, that their Interpretations have been admitted without contradiction; only upon their own credit, and look'd upon with that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is commonly paid to Antiquity, as tho' the World, in proceſs of time, was grown younger

Since therefore every one is ſo much taken up with this Sect, and pays ſo great a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe that are call'd the eminent Fathers; 'tis no wonder that the Papiſts, who above all others, put a high value upon them, ſhould uſe their Language, and conſecrate all their Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And 'tis long ſince the Proteſtants have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that theſe their Adverſaries have founded the Prayers for the dead, the worſhiping of Saints, and the like Doctrines, upon ſome expreſſions of the Fathers, that ſeem to favour them. When af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they were compell'd to give ſome proof out of the Holy Scripture, they found the firſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Purgatory, in the 1ſt <hi>Epiſtle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, Chap.</hi> 3.13. <hi>That fire ſhall try every Man's work.</hi> 'Tis almoſt the ſame with thoſe that are bred amongſt the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> how great a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and how learned ſoever any one may be, he will find no reaſon, and much leſs a neceſſity, to believe that Chriſt is locally and viſibly aſcended to Heaven, but it will appear to him a neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that our Lord, after his Reſurrection, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated thro' doors ſhut up, and that his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is omnipotent.

It is not, thought convenient for them to know what Soul and Body are; wherein conſiſts the Eſſence of the Soul, or that of the Angels and Devils; and what knowledge and operations thoſe Spirits are capable of; and what ſhare and adminiſtration they take here below in human Affairs.

That which may adorn the Human Mind with Light, and form its Judgment, is what is leſs intended to be acquired in Univerſities, tho' they ſeem to be the place where ſuch a rare thing ſhould be gotten, which moſt unhappily affords not the means to grow rich; I mean <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and that part of natural <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that diſcovers the nature and courſe of the Heavens; not becauſe they treat of our preſent ſubject, but for two other reaſons I ſhall add. The firſt is, that more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is to be found in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> than in all other Sciences; becauſe they are grounded upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Principles; ſuch Students as are uſed to the certainty of theſe Principles, will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for truth, ſuch as are not attended with a full and entire conviction, and put a little value upon ſuch Sciences, as have not the ſame certainty. But the Second Reaſon is ſtill more particular; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> eſpecially that part that treats of the knowledge of Stars, manifeſtly diſcovers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, that undeniably ſhew the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters accommodated themſelves to the ſtile and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Vulgar, and ſpeak of the Heavens, Earth, Sun, Moon and Stars, not according to their own nature, and as they are in themſelves; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common notions of Men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that are ſomewhat addicted to that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, credit not ſo eaſily the diſcourſes of other Men, and are not ſatisfied with probabilites. They are not diſpoſed to fill the Air with Spirits, nor to fix them to Stars, nor to confound Spirits and Stars together. But the miſchief is, as I have already hinted, that few Learned give up themſelves to that part of the Sciences, tho' it is the moſt uſeful and beautiful of all.</p>

All theſe prejudices with which we have been once fill'd, which have been rooted in us more and more, by the ways already alleag'd, which have grown by the new nouriſhment they daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which have neither been baniſhed, nor weaken'd by the endeavours of a better informed Judgment; all theſe prejudices, I ſay, are no where more ſenſible than in the ſubject we treat of. And therefore we have deſtin'd this Firſt Book, to eſtabliſh this Truth, and make it very plain; to the end, it might be clearly perceived, that all thoſe Opinions concerning the Devils, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, and Witchcraft, draw their firſt Original from the Heathens, who communicated them to the Jews, during the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Captivity, where they had more converſation with the Philoſophers, than in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whilſt they liv'd ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all other Nations of the Earth.

Thus was inſenſibly laid the foundation, on which the great aedifice of Popery is now founded and rais'd.</p>

For why ſhould not they be held for Heathen Legends, what the Pagans have publiſhed of their Miracles, Oracles, Gods, Aërial Spectres, Dreams, and the like prodigies? That is, why do we not call 'em Lies, as we rightly ſo name the <hi>Roman</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends? Have we more reaſon to look upon as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious

Whence comes it, that we publickly laugh at (both in our diſcourſes and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,) the ſham miracles of the former, as being meer deluſions and trifles, and that we approve, both by our words and our Books, the narrations that the latter make of the wonders ſeen amongſt them, and that we quote them as true, thô they be of the ſame matter and weight with the others? The antiquity of thoſe Authors and of the times in which they have written, has it ſo much power and efficacy? and muſt we more eaſily credit ſtories, becauſe they are ſaid to have happen'd a long while ago, and in far remote Countries? But what's that to the main point? Truth fits not it ſelf in this manner to the inclinations of Men.

'Tis becauſe of the particular hatred we have for Popery, from which we have been ſeparated not long ſince, and with which we

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59386:175"/>not allow'd to go to Corinth.</hi> Whoever intends to overcome ſo many difficulties, cannot hope to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but by his diligence, eagerneſs, and earneſtneſs. To this end, I know not a better means than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Interpretation of the Holy Scripture, as though it had never been interpreted before; to ſearch into all things carefully, to enquire after the Connection of all the Doctrines contained in it; and to have recourſe to Interpreters only to borrow ſome light for dark places, but not to follow them as true and infallible Guides. This I hope to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in my ſecond Book, if God gives me life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. But doubtleſs this advice will prove ſerviceable only to my ſelf, and ſome few Perſons who ſhall perceive its uſefulneſs; neither have I reaſon to hope that it ſhould ever be reliſht by the publick; Popery being not ſo far eradicated out of the Proteſtants Hearts, but that it ſprings up again from time to time in ſome places, There is a fault, of which the viſible Church was never free; that is, the having too much deference for Authority and Tradition. For though a great Reſpect ought to be paid to thoſe that are eſtabliſhed as God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Church, and that ſeveral things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her external Government, ought to be ruled by her Directors; yet we muſt not give up our ſelves wholly to them. There is a great regard to be had as to this Point, and a Mean to be choſen with much Diſcretion; leſt to avoid the reproach of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence and Irregularity, we ſhould aſcribe too much to the Authority of the Church, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of her chief Doctors: In this Senſe it is; that one of the moſt learned Men of this Age undertook to aſſert this Theſis, <hi>Papatus eſt inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis ab Eccleſia; The Popedom is inſeparable from the Church.</hi> As for me, who perhaps have more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in this matter than any other Perſon in theſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59386:176"/>Provinces; I dare not hope this method ſhould change, and even have no Reaſon to believe it, conſidering what paſſes whilſt I am taken up with this preſent work. However, I ſhall proſecute my deſign, relying upon the Grace of God, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that I write for maintaining the Truth, and that I cannot forbear to do it, ſince I am informed of it. After all, as I aim at nothing elſe but the Glory of God, and the defence of the true Faith; ſo I ſee that my labour has not been in vain, but has already produced great Fruit. This bears up my Courage, and inſpires me with great ardour, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to the compoſition of the following Books.</p>
